    <lg n="1" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">BETWEEN Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The spectacles set them unhappily wrong;</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To which the said spectacles ought to belong.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">So the Tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning,</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">So fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And your lordship he said, will undoubtedly find,</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Which amounts to possession time out of mind.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then holding the spectacles up to the court —</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle,</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">As wide as the ridge of the Nose is, in short,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Design'd to sit close to it, just like a saddle.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Again would your lordship a moment suppose</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">('Tis a case that has happen'd and may be again)</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Pray who wou'd or who cou'd wear spectacles then?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">On the whole it appears, and my argument shows</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With a reasoning the court will never condemn,</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how,</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes,</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But what were his arguments few people know,</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For the court did not think they were equally wise.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">So his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone,</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Decisive and clear without one if or but —</l>
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By day-light or candle-light — Eyes should be shut.</l>
