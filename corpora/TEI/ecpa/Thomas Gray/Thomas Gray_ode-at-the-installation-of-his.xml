    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">"HENCE, avaunt, ('tis holy ground)</l>
     <l n="2">" Comus, and his midnight-crew,</l>
     <l n="3">"And Ignorance with looks profound,</l>
     <l n="4">" And dreaming Sloth of pallid hue,</l>
     <l n="5">"Mad Sedition's cry profane,</l>
     <l n="6">" Servitude that hugs her chain,</l>
     <l n="7">"Nor in these consecrated bowers</l>
     <l n="8">" Let painted Flattery hide her serpent train in flowers.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">"Nor Envy base, nor creeping Gain</l>
     <l n="10">" Dare the Muse's walk to slain,</l>
     <l n="11">"While bright-ey'd Science watches round:</l>
     <l n="12">" Hence, away, 'tis holy ground! "</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="13">From yonder realms of empyrean day</l>
     <l n="14">Bursts on my ear th' indignant lay:</l>
     <l n="15">There sit the sainted Sage, the Bard divine,</l>
     <l n="16">The Few, whom Genius gave to shine</l>
     <l n="17">Through every unborn age, and undiscovered clime.</l>
     <l n="18">Rapt in celestial transport they,</l>
     <l n="19">Yet hither oft a glance from high</l>
     <l n="20">They send of tender sympathy</l>
     <l n="21">To bless the place, where on their opening soul</l>
     <l n="22">First the genuine ardor stole.</l>
     <l n="23">'Twas Milton struck the deep-toned shell,</l>
     <l n="24">And, as the choral warblings round him swell,</l>
     <l n="25">Meek Newton's self bends from his state sublime,</l>
     <l n="26">And nods his hoary head, and listens to the rhyme.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="27">"Ye brown o'er-arching groves,</l>
     <l n="28">" That Contemplation loves,</l>
     <l n="29">"Where willowy Camus lingers with delight!</l>
     <l n="30">" Oft at the blush of dawn</l>
     <l n="31">"I trod your level lawn,</l>
     <l n="32">" Oft woo'd the gleam of Cynthia silver-bright</l>
     <l n="33">"In cloisters dim, far from the haunts of Folly,</l>
     <l n="34">" With Freedom by my side, and soft-ey'd Melancholy.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="35">"What is Grandeur, what is Power?</l>
     <l n="36">" Heavier toil, superior pain.</l>
     <l n="37">"What the bright reward we gain?</l>
     <l n="38">" The grateful memory of the Good.</l>
     <l n="39">"Sweet is the breath of vernal shower,</l>
     <l n="40">" The bee's collected treasures sweet,</l>
     <l n="41">"Sweet music's melting fall, but sweeter yet</l>
     <l n="42">" The still small voice of Gratitude.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="43">Foremost and leaning from her golden cloud</l>
     <l n="44">The venerable Margaret see!</l>
     <l n="45">"Welcome, my noble son, (she cries aloud)</l>
     <l n="46">" To this, thy kindred train, and me:</l>
     <l n="47">"Pleas'd in thy lineaments we trace</l>
     <l n="48">" A Tudor's fire, a Beaufort's grace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="49">"Thy liberal heart, thy judging eye,</l>
     <l n="50">" The flower unheeded shall descry,</l>
     <l n="51">"And bid it round heaven's altars shed</l>
     <l n="52">" The fragrance of its blushing head:</l>
     <l n="53">"Shall raise from earth the latent gem</l>
     <l n="54">" To glitter on the diadem.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="55">"Lo, Granta waits to lead her blooming band,</l>
     <l n="56">" Not obvious, not obtrusive, she</l>
     <l n="57">"No vulgar praise, no venal incense flings;</l>
     <l n="58">" Nor dares with courtly tongue refin'd</l>
     <l n="59">"Profane thy inborn royalty of mind:</l>
     <l n="60">" She reveres herself and thee.</l>
     <l n="61">"With modest pride to grace thy youthful brow</l>
     <l n="62">" The laureate wreath that Cecil wore she brings,</l>
     <l n="63">"And to thy just, thy gentle hand</l>
     <l n="64">" Submits the fasces of her sway,</l>
     <l n="65">"While spirits blest above and men below</l>
     <l n="66">" Join with glad voice the loud symphonious lay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="67">"Thro' the wild waves as they roar,</l>
     <l n="68">" With watchful eye and dauntless mien</l>
     <l n="69">"Thy steady course of honour keep,</l>
     <l n="70">" Nor fear the rocks, nor seek the shore:</l>
     <l n="71">"The star of Brunswick smiles serene,</l>
     <l n="72">" And gilds the horrors of the deep.</l>
