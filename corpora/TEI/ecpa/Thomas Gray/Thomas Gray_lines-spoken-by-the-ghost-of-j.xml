    <lg n="1" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="1">From purling streams and the Elysian scene,</l>
     <l n="2">From groves that smile with never-fading green,</l>
     <l n="3">I reascend: in Atropos' despite</l>
     <l n="4">Restored to Celadon and upper light.</l>
     <l n="5">Ye gods, that sway the regions under ground,</l>
     <l n="6">Reveal to mortal view your realms profound;</l>
     <l n="7">At his command admit the eye of day:</l>
     <l n="8">When Celadon commands, what god can disobey?</l>
     <l n="9">Nor seeks he your Tartarean fires to know,</l>
     <l n="10">The house of torture and the abyss of woe;</l>
     <l n="11">But happy fields and mansions free from pain,</l>
     <l n="12">Gay meads and springing flowers, best please the gentle swain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="13">That little, naked, melancholy thing,</l>
     <l n="14">My soul, when first she tried her flight to wing,</l>
     <l n="15">Began with speed new regions to explore,</l>
     <l n="16">And blundered through a narrow postern door.</l>
     <l n="17">First most devoutly having said its prayers,</l>
     <l n="18">It tumbled down a thousand pair of stairs,</l>
     <l n="19">Through entries long, through cellars vast and deep,</l>
     <l n="20">Where ghostly rats their habitations keep,</l>
     <l n="21">Where spiders spread their webs and owlish goblins sleep.</l>
     <l n="22">After so many chances had befell,</l>
     <l n="23">It came into a mead of asphodel:</l>
     <l n="24">Betwixt the confines of the light and dark</l>
     <l n="25">It lies, of 'Lysium the St. James's Park.</l>
     <l n="26">Here spirit-beaux flutter along the Mall,</l>
     <l n="27">And shadows in disguise skate o'er the iced Canal;</l>
     <l n="28">Here groves embowered and more sequestered shades,</l>
     <l n="29">Frequented by the ghosts of ancient maids,</l>
     <l n="30">Are seen to rise. The melancholy scene,</l>
     <l n="31">With gloomy haunts and twilight walks between,</l>
     <l n="32">Conceals the wayward band: here spend their time</l>
     <l n="33">Greensickness girls that died in youthful prime,</l>
     <l n="34">Virgins forlorn, all dressed in willow-green-i,</l>
     <l n="35">With Queen Elizabeth and Nicolini.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="36">More to reveal, or many words to use,</l>
     <l n="37">Would tire alike your patience and my muse.</l>
     <l n="38">Believe that never was so faithful found</l>
     <l n="39">Queen Proserpine to Pluto under ground,</l>
     <l n="40">Or Cleopatra to her Mark Antony,</l>
     <l n="41">As Orozmades to his Celadony.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="42">P.S. Lucrece for half a crown will show you fun,</l>
     <l n="43">But Mrs. Oldfield is become a nun.</l>
     <l n="44">Nobles and cits, Prince Pluto and his spouse,</l>
     <l n="45">Flock to the ghost of Covent-Garden House:</l>
     <l n="46">Plays, which were hissed above, below revive,</l>
     <l n="47">When dead applauded that were damned alive.</l>
     <l n="48">The people, as in life, still keep their passions,</l>
     <l n="49">But differ something from the world in fashions.</l>
     <l n="50">Queen Artemisia breakfasts on bohea,</l>
     <l n="51">And Alexander wears a ramilie.</l>
