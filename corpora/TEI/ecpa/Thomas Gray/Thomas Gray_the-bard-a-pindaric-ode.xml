    <lg n="1" stanza_type="strophe">
     <l n="1">'Ruin seize thee, ruthless king!</l>
     <l n="2">'Confusion on thy banners wait,</l>
     <l n="3">'Though fanned by Conquest's crimson wing</l>
     <l n="4">'They mock the air with idle state.</l>
     <l n="5">'Helm nor hauberk's twisted mail,</l>
     <l n="6">'Nor even thy virtues, tyrant, shall avail</l>
     <l n="7">'To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,</l>
     <l n="8">'From Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears! '</l>
     <l n="9">Such were the sounds, that o'er the crested pride</l>
     <l n="10">Of the first Edward scattered wild dismay,</l>
     <l n="11">As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side</l>
     <l n="12">He wound with toilsome march his long array.</l>
     <l n="13">Stout Gloucester stood aghast in speechless trance:</l>
     <l n="14">'To arms!' cried Mortimer, and couched his quivering lance.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="antistrophe">
     <l n="15">On a rock, whose haughty brow</l>
     <l n="16">Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood,</l>
     <l n="17">Robed in the sable garb of woe,</l>
     <l n="18">With haggard eyes the poet stood;</l>
     <l n="19">(Loose his beard, and hoary hair</l>
     <l n="20">Streamed, like a meteor, to the troubled air)</l>
     <l n="21">And with a master's hand, and prophet's fire,</l>
     <l n="22">Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre.</l>
     <l n="23">'Hark, how each giant-oak, and desert cave,</l>
     <l n="24">'Sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath!</l>
     <l n="25">'O'er thee, oh king! their hundred arms they wave,</l>
     <l n="26">'Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe;</l>
     <l n="27">'Vocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day,</l>
     <l n="28">'To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="epode">
     <l n="29">'Cold is Cadwallo's tongue,</l>
     <l n="30">'That hushed the stormy main:</l>
     <l n="31">'Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed:</l>
     <l n="32">'Mountains, ye mourn in vain</l>
     <l n="33">'Modred, whose magic song</l>
     <l n="34">'Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topped head.</l>
     <l n="35">'On dreary Arvon's shore they lie,</l>
     <l n="36">'Smeared with gore, and ghastly pale:</l>
     <l n="37">'Far, far aloof the affrighted ravens sail;</l>
     <l n="38">'The famished eagle screams, and passes by.</l>
     <l n="39">'Dear lost companions of my tuneful art,</l>
     <l n="40">'Dear, as the light that visits these sad eyes,</l>
     <l n="41">'Dear, as the ruddy drops that warm my heart,</l>
     <l n="42">'Ye died amidst your dying country's cries â€”</l>
     <l n="43">'No more I weep. They do not sleep.</l>
     <l n="44">'On yonder cliffs, a grisly band,</l>
     <l n="45">'I see them sit, they linger yet,</l>
     <l n="46">'Avengers of their native land:</l>
     <l n="47">'With me in dreadful harmony they join,</l>
     <l n="48">'And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line.'</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="strophe">
     <l n="49">"Weave the warp, and weave the woof,</l>
     <l n="50">"The winding-sheet of Edward's race.</l>
     <l n="51">"Give ample room, and verge enough</l>
     <l n="52">"The characters of hell to trace.</l>
     <l n="53">"Mark the year and mark the night,</l>
     <l n="54">"When Severn shall re-echo with affright</l>
     <l n="55">"The shrieks of death, through Berkeley's roofs that ring,</l>
     <l n="56">"Shrieks of an agonizing King!</l>
     <l n="57">"She-wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs,</l>
     <l n="58">"That tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate,</l>
     <l n="59">"From thee be born, who o'er thy country hangs</l>
     <l n="60">"The scourge of heaven. What terrors round him wait!</l>
     <l n="61">"Amazement in his van, with Flight combined,</l>
     <l n="62">"And Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="antistrophe">
     <l n="63">"Mighty victor, mighty lord,</l>
     <l n="64">"Low on his funeral couch he lies!</l>
     <l n="65">"No pitying heart, no eye, afford</l>
     <l n="66">"A tear to grace his obsequies.</l>
     <l n="67">"Is the sable warrior fled?</l>
     <l n="68">"Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead.</l>
     <l n="69">"The swarm that in thy noon-tide beam were born?</l>
     <l n="70">"Gone to salute the rising morn.</l>
     <l n="71">"Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows,</l>
     <l n="72">"While proudly riding o'er the azure realm</l>
     <l n="73">"In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes;</l>
     <l n="74">"Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;</l>
     <l n="75">"Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway,</l>
     <l n="76">"That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening-prey.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="epode">
     <l n="77">"Fill high the sparkling bowl,</l>
     <l n="78">"The rich repast prepare,</l>
     <l n="79">"Reft of a crown, he yet may share the feast:</l>
     <l n="80">"Close by the regal chair</l>
     <l n="81">"Fell Thirst and Famine scowl</l>
     <l n="82">"A baleful smile upon their baffled guest.</l>
     <l n="83">"Heard ye the din of battle bray,</l>
     <l n="84">"Lance to lance, and horse to horse?</l>
     <l n="85">"Long years of havoc urge their destined course,</l>
     <l n="86">"And through the kindred squadrons mow their way.</l>
     <l n="87">"Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,</l>
     <l n="88">"With many a foul and midnight murther fed,</l>
     <l n="89">"Revere his consort's faith, his father's fame,</l>
     <l n="90">"And spare the meek usurper's holy head.</l>
     <l n="91">"Above, below, the rose of snow,</l>
     <l n="92">"Twined with her blushing foe, we spread:</l>
     <l n="93">"The bristled Boar in infant-gore</l>
     <l n="94">"Wallows beneath the thorny shade.</l>
     <l n="95">"Now, brothers, bending o'er the accursed loom,</l>
     <l n="96">"Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="strophe">
     <l n="97">"Edward, lo! to sudden fate</l>
     <l n="98">"(Weave we the woof. The thread is spun)</l>
     <l n="99">"Half of thy heart we consecrate.</l>
     <l n="100">"(The web is wove. The work is done.)"</l>
     <l n="101">'Stay, oh stay! nor thus forlorn</l>
     <l n="102">'Leave me unblessed, unpitied, here to mourn:</l>
     <l n="103">'In yon bright track, that fires the western skies,</l>
     <l n="104">'They melt, they vanish from my eyes.</l>
     <l n="105">'But oh! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height</l>
     <l n="106">'Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll?</l>
     <l n="107">'Visions of glory, spare my aching sight,</l>
     <l n="108">'Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul!</l>
     <l n="109">'No more our long-lost Arthur we bewail.</l>
     <l n="110">'All-hail, ye genuine kings, Britannia's issue, hail!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="antistrophe">
     <l n="111">'Girt with many a baron bold</l>
     <l n="112">'Sublime their starry fronts they rear;</l>
     <l n="113">'And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old</l>
     <l n="114">'In bearded majesty, appear.</l>
     <l n="115">'In the midst a form divine!</l>
     <l n="116">'Her eye proclaims her of the Briton-line;</l>
     <l n="117">'Her lion-port, her awe-commanding face,</l>
     <l n="118">'Attempered sweet to virgin-grace.</l>
     <l n="119">'What strings symphonious tremble in the air,</l>
     <l n="120">'What strains of vocal transport round her play!</l>
     <l n="121">'Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear;</l>
     <l n="122">'They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.</l>
     <l n="123">'Bright Rapture calls, and soaring, as she sings,</l>
     <l n="124">'Waves in the eye of heaven her many-coloured wings.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9" stanza_type="epode">
     <l n="125">'The verse adorn again</l>
     <l n="126">'Fierce war and faithful love,</l>
     <l n="127">'And truth severe, by fairy fiction dressed.</l>
     <l n="128">'In buskined measures move</l>
     <l n="129">'Pale Grief, and pleasing Pain,</l>
     <l n="130">'With Horror, tyrant of the throbbing breast.</l>
     <l n="131">'A voice, as of the cherub-choir,</l>
     <l n="132">'Gales from blooming Eden bear;</l>
     <l n="133">'And distant warblings lessen on my ear,</l>
     <l n="134">'That lost in long futurity expire.</l>
     <l n="135">'Fond impious man, think'st thou, yon sanguine cloud,</l>
     <l n="136">'Raised by thy breath, has quenched the orb of day?</l>
     <l n="137">'Tomorrow he repairs the golden flood,</l>
     <l n="138">'And warms the nations with redoubled ray.</l>
     <l n="139">'Enough for me: with joy I see</l>
     <l n="140">'The different doom our fates assign.</l>
     <l n="141">'Be thine despair and sceptered care;</l>
     <l n="142">'To triumph, and to die, are mine. '</l>
     <l n="143">He spoke, and headlong from the mountain's height</l>
     <l n="144">Deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night.</l>
