    <lg n="1" stanza_type="strophe">
     <l n="1">Awake, Aeolian lyre, awake,</l>
     <l n="2">And give to rapture all thy trembling strings.</l>
     <l n="3">From Helicon's harmonious springs</l>
     <l n="4">A thousand rills their mazy progress take:</l>
     <l n="5">The laughing flowers, that round them blow,</l>
     <l n="6">Drink life and fragrance as they flow.</l>
     <l n="7">Now the rich stream of music winds along,</l>
     <l n="8">Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong,</l>
     <l n="9">Through verdant vales and Ceres' golden reign:</l>
     <l n="10">Now rowling down the steep amain,</l>
     <l n="11">Headlong, impetuous, see it pour:</l>
     <l n="12">The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="antistrophe">
     <l n="13">Oh! Sovereign of the willing soul,</l>
     <l n="14">Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs,</l>
     <l n="15">Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares</l>
     <l n="16">And frantic Passions hear thy soft control.</l>
     <l n="17">On Thracia's hills the Lord of War,</l>
     <l n="18">Has curbed the fury of his car,</l>
     <l n="19">And dropped his thirsty lance at thy command.</l>
     <l n="20">Perching on the sceptered hand</l>
     <l n="21">Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feathered king</l>
     <l n="22">With ruffled plumes and flagging wing:</l>
     <l n="23">Quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie</l>
     <l n="24">The terror of his beak, and lightnings of his eye.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="epode">
     <l n="25">Thee the voice, the dance, obey,</l>
     <l n="26">Tempered to thy warbled lay.</l>
     <l n="27">O'er Idalia's velvet-green</l>
     <l n="28">The rosy-crowned Loves are seen</l>
     <l n="29">On Cytherea's day</l>
     <l n="30">With antic Sports and blue-eyed Pleasures,</l>
     <l n="31">Frisking light in frolic measures;</l>
     <l n="32">Now pursuing, now retreating,</l>
     <l n="33">Now in circling troops they meet:</l>
     <l n="34">To brisk notes in cadence beating</l>
     <l n="35">Glance their many-twinkling feet.</l>
     <l n="36">Slow melting strains their queen's approach declare:</l>
     <l n="37">Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay.</l>
     <l n="38">With arms sublime, that float upon the air,</l>
     <l n="39">In gliding state she wins her easy way:</l>
     <l n="40">O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move</l>
     <l n="41">The bloom of young desire and purple light of love.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="strophe">
     <l n="42">Man's feeble race what ills await,</l>
     <l n="43">Labour, and penury, the racks of pain,</l>
     <l n="44">Disease, and sorrow's weeping train,</l>
     <l n="45">And death, sad refuge from the storms of fate!</l>
     <l n="46">The fond complaint, my song, disprove,</l>
     <l n="47">And justify the laws of Jove.</l>
     <l n="48">Say, has he given in vain the heavenly Muse?</l>
     <l n="49">Night, and all her sickly dews,</l>
     <l n="50">Her spectres wan, and birds of boding cry,</l>
     <l n="51">He gives to range the dreary sky:</l>
     <l n="52">Till down the eastern cliffs afar</l>
     <l n="53">Hyperion's march they spy, and glittering shafts of war.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="antistrophe">
     <l n="54">In climes beyond the solar road,</l>
     <l n="55">Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam,</l>
     <l n="56">The Muse has broke the twilight-gloom</l>
     <l n="57">To cheer the shivering native's dull abode.</l>
     <l n="58">And oft, beneath the odorous shade</l>
     <l n="59">Of Chile's boundless forests laid,</l>
     <l n="60">She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat</l>
     <l n="61">In loose numbers wildly sweet</l>
     <l n="62">Their feather-cinctured chiefs, and dusky loves.</l>
     <l n="63">Her track, where'er the goddess roves,</l>
     <l n="64">Glory pursue, and generous Shame,</l>
     <l n="65">The unconquerable Mind, and Freedom's holy flame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="epode">
     <l n="66">Woods that wave o'er Delphi's steep,</l>
     <l n="67">Isles that crown the Aegean deep,</l>
     <l n="68">Fields that cool Ilissus laves,</l>
     <l n="69">Or where Maeander's amber waves</l>
     <l n="70">In lingering lab'rinths creep,</l>
     <l n="71">How do your tuneful echoes languish,</l>
     <l n="72">Mute, but to the voice of anguish?</l>
     <l n="73">Where each old poetic mountain</l>
     <l n="74">Inspiration breathed around:</l>
     <l n="75">Every shade and hallowed fountain</l>
     <l n="76">Murmured deep a solemn sound:</l>
     <l n="77">Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour</l>
     <l n="78">Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains.</l>
     <l n="79">Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant-power,</l>
     <l n="80">And coward Vice that revels in her chains.</l>
     <l n="81">When Latium had her lofty spirit lost,</l>
     <l n="82">They sought, oh Albion! next thy sea-encircled coast.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="strophe">
     <l n="83">Far from the sun and summer-gale,</l>
     <l n="84">In thy green lap was Nature's darling laid,</l>
     <l n="85">What time, where lucid Avon strayed,</l>
     <l n="86">To him the mighty Mother did unveil</l>
     <l n="87">Her awful face: the dauntless child</l>
     <l n="88">Stretched forth his little arms and smiled.</l>
     <l n="89">'This pencil take,' (she said) 'whose colours clear</l>
     <l n="90">Richly paint the vernal year:</l>
     <l n="91">Thine too these golden keys, immortal boy!</l>
     <l n="92">This can unlock the gates of joy;</l>
     <l n="93">Of horror that, and thrilling fears,</l>
     <l n="94">Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears.'</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="antistrophe">
     <l n="95">Nor second he, that rode sublime</l>
     <l n="96">Upon the seraph-wings of Ecstasy,</l>
     <l n="97">The secrets of the abyss to spy.</l>
     <l n="98">He passed the flaming bounds of place and time:</l>
     <l n="99">The living throne, the sapphire-blaze,</l>
     <l n="100">Where angels tremble while they gaze,</l>
     <l n="101">He saw; but blasted with excess of light,</l>
     <l n="102">Closed his eyes in endless night.</l>
     <l n="103">Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car,</l>
     <l n="104">Wide o'er the fields of glory bear</l>
     <l n="105">Two coursers of ethereal race,</l>
     <l n="106">With necks in thunder clothed, and long-resounding pace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9" stanza_type="epode">
     <l n="107">Hark, his hands the lyre explore!</l>
     <l n="108">Bright-eyed Fancy hovering o'er</l>
     <l n="109">Scatters from her pictured urn</l>
     <l n="110">Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.</l>
     <l n="111">But ah! 'tis heard no more —</l>
     <l n="112">Oh! lyre divine, what daring spirit</l>
     <l n="113">Wakes thee now? Though he inherit</l>
     <l n="114">Nor the pride, nor ample pinion,</l>
     <l n="115">That the Theban eagle bear</l>
     <l n="116">Sailing with supreme dominion</l>
     <l n="117">Through the azure deep of air:</l>
     <l n="118">Yet oft before his infant eyes would run</l>
     <l n="119">Such forms, as glitter in the Muse's ray</l>
     <l n="120">With orient hues, unborrowed of the sun:</l>
     <l n="121">Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way</l>
     <l n="122">Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate,</l>
     <l n="123">Beneath the Good how far — but far above the Great.</l>
