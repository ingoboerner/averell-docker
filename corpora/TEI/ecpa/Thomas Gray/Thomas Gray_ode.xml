    <lg n="1" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="1">AWAKE, Aeolian lyre, awake,</l>
     <l n="2">And give to rapture all thy trembling strings.</l>
     <l n="3">From Helicon's harmonious springs</l>
     <l n="4">A thousand rills their mazy progress take:</l>
     <l n="5">The laughing flowers, that round them blow,</l>
     <l n="6">Drink life and fragance as they flow.</l>
     <l n="7">Now the rich stream of music winds along</l>
     <l n="8">Deep, majestic, smooth and strong,</l>
     <l n="9">Thro' verdant vales, and Ceres' golden reign:</l>
     <l n="10">Now rolling down the steep amain,</l>
     <l n="11">Headlong, impetuous, see it pour:</l>
     <l n="12">The rocks, and nodding groves rebellow to the roar.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="13">Oh! Sovereign of the willing soul,</l>
     <l n="14">Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs,</l>
     <l n="15">Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares,</l>
     <l n="16">And frantic Passions hear thy soft controul.</l>
     <l n="17">On Thracia's hills the Lord of War</l>
     <l n="18">Has curb'd the fury of his car,</l>
     <l n="19">And drop'd his thirsty lance at thy command.</l>
     <l n="20">Perching on the scept'red hand</l>
     <l n="21">Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather'd king</l>
     <l n="22">With ruffled plumes, and flagging wing:</l>
     <l n="23">Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie</l>
     <l n="24">The terror of his beak, and light'nings of his eye.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="25">Thee the voice, the dance, obey,</l>
     <l n="26">Temper'd to thy warbled lay.</l>
     <l n="27">O'er Idalia's velvet-green</l>
     <l n="28">The rosy-crowned Loves are seen</l>
     <l n="29">On Cytherea's day,</l>
     <l n="30">With antic Sports, and blue-eyed Pleasures,</l>
     <l n="31">Frisking light in frolic measures;</l>
     <l n="32">Now pursuing, now retreating,</l>
     <l n="33">Now in circling troops they meet:</l>
     <l n="34">To brisk notes in cadence beating</l>
     <l n="35">Glance their many-twinkling feet.</l>
     <l n="36">Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare:</l>
     <l n="37">Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay.</l>
     <l n="38">With arms sublime, that float upon the air,</l>
     <l n="39">In gliding state she wins her easy way:</l>
     <l n="40">O'er her warm cheek, and rising bosom, move</l>
     <l n="41">The bloom of young Desire, and purple light of Love.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="42">Man's feeble race what Ills await,</l>
     <l n="43">Labour, and Penury, the racks of Pain,</l>
     <l n="44">Disease, and Sorrow's weeping train,</l>
     <l n="45">And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate!</l>
     <l n="46">The fond complaint, my Song, disprove,</l>
     <l n="47">And justify the laws of Jove.</l>
     <l n="48">Say, has he giv'n in vain the heav'nly Muse?</l>
     <l n="49">Night, and all her sickly dews,</l>
     <l n="50">Her Spectres wan, and Birds of boding cry,</l>
     <l n="51">He gives to range the dreary sky:</l>
     <l n="52">Till down the eastern cliffs afar</l>
     <l n="53">Hyperion's march they spy, and glitt'ring shafts of war.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="54">In climes beyond the solar road,</l>
     <l n="55">Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam,</l>
     <l n="56">The Muse has broke the twilight-gloom</l>
     <l n="57">To chear the shiv'ring Native's dull abode.</l>
     <l n="58">And oft, beneath the od'rous shade</l>
     <l n="59">Of Chili's boundless forests laid,</l>
     <l n="60">She deigns to hear the savage Youth repeat,</l>
     <l n="61">In loose numbers wildly sweet,</l>
     <l n="62">Their feather-cinctured Chiefs, and dusky Loves.</l>
     <l n="63">Her track, where'er the Goddess roves,</l>
     <l n="64">Glory pursue, and generous Shame,</l>
     <l n="65">Th' unconquerable Mind, and Freedom's holy flame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="66">Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep,</l>
     <l n="67">Isles, that crown th' Egaean deep,</l>
     <l n="68">Fields, that cool Ilissus laves,</l>
     <l n="69">Or where Maeander's amber waves</l>
     <l n="70">In lingering Lab'rinths creep,</l>
     <l n="71">How do your tuneful Echo's languish,</l>
     <l n="72">Mute, but to the voice of Anguish!</l>
     <l n="73">Where each old poetic Mountain</l>
     <l n="74">Inspiration breath'd around;</l>
     <l n="75">Ev'ry shade and hallow'd Fountain</l>
     <l n="76">Murmur'd deep a solemn sound:</l>
     <l n="77">Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour</l>
     <l n="78">Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains.</l>
     <l n="79">Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant-Power,</l>
     <l n="80">And coward Vice, that revels in her chains.</l>
     <l n="81">When Latium had her lofty spirit lost,</l>
     <l n="82">They sought, oh Albion! next, thy sea-encircled coast.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="83">Far from the sun and summer-gale,</l>
     <l n="84">In thy green lap was Nature's Darling laid,</l>
     <l n="85">What time, where lucid Avon stray'd,</l>
     <l n="86">To Him the mighty Mother did unveil</l>
     <l n="87">Her aweful face: The dauntless Child</l>
     <l n="88">Stretch'd forth his little arms, and smil'd.</l>
     <l n="89">This pencil take (she said) whose colours clear</l>
     <l n="90">Richly paint the vernal year:</l>
     <l n="91">Thine too these golden keys, immortal Boy!</l>
     <l n="92">This can unlock the gates of Joy;</l>
     <l n="93">Of Horrour that, and thrilling Fears,</l>
     <l n="94">Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic Tears.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="95">Nor second He, that rode sublime</l>
     <l n="96">Upon the seraph-wings of Extasy,</l>
     <l n="97">The secrets of th' Abyss to spy.</l>
     <l n="98">He pass'd the flaming bounds of Place and Time:</l>
     <l n="99">The living Throne, the saphire-blaze,</l>
     <l n="100">Where Angels tremble while they gaze,</l>
     <l n="101">He saw; but blasted with excess of light,</l>
     <l n="102">Closed his eyes in endless night.</l>
     <l n="103">Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car,</l>
     <l n="104">Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear</l>
     <l n="105">Two coursers of ethereal race,</l>
     <l n="106">With necks in thunder cloath'd, and long-resounding pace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="107">Hark, his hands the lyre explore!</l>
     <l n="108">Bright-eyed Fancy hovering o'er</l>
     <l n="109">Scatters from her pictur'd urn</l>
     <l n="110">Thoughts, that breathe, and words, that burn.</l>
     <l n="111">But ah! 'tis heard no more —</l>
     <l n="112">Oh! Lyre divine, what daring Spirit</l>
     <l n="113">Wakes thee now? tho' he inherit</l>
     <l n="114">Nor the pride, nor ample pinion,</l>
     <l n="115">That the Theban Eagle bear</l>
     <l n="116">Sailing with supreme dominion</l>
     <l n="117">Thro' the azure deep of air:</l>
     <l n="118">Yet oft before his infant eyes would run</l>
     <l n="119">Such forms, as glitter in the Muse's ray</l>
     <l n="120">With orient hues, unborrow'd of the Sun:</l>
     <l n="121">Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way</l>
     <l n="122">Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate,</l>
     <l n="123">Beneath the Good how far — but far above the Great.</l>
