     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">dinner was over, the table-cloth gone,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The bottles of wine and the glasses brought on,</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The gentlemen fill'd up the sparkling glasses,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To drink to their King, to their country and lasses;</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The ladies a glass or two only requir'd,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To th' drawing-room then in due order retir'd;</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The gentlemen likewise that chose to drink tea;</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And, after discussing the news of the day,</l>
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What wife was suspected, what daughter elop'd,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What thief was detected, that 'twas to be hop'd,</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The rascals would all be convicted, and rop'd;</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What chambermaid kiss'd when her lady was out;</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who won, and who lost, the last night at the rout;</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What lord gone to France, and what tradesman unpaid,</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And who and who danc'd at the last masquerade;</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What banker stopt payment with evil intention,</l>
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And twenty more things much too tedious to mention.</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Miss Rhymer says, Mrs. Routella, ma'am, pray</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Have you seen the new book (that we talk'd of that day,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">At your house you remember) of Poems, 'twas said</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Produc'd by the pen of a poor Servant Maid?</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The company silent, the answer expected;</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Mrs. Routella, when she'd recollected;</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Why, ma'am, I have bought it for Charlotte; the child</l>
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Is so fond of a book, I'm afraid it is spoil'd:</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I thought to have read it myself, but forgat it;</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In short, I have never had time to look at it.</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Perhaps I may look it o'er some other day;</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Is there any thing in it worth reading, I pray?</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For your nice attention, there's nothing can 'scape.</l>
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She answer'd, — There's one piece, whose subject's a Rape.</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A Rape! interrupted the Captain Bonair,</l>
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A delicate theme for a female I swear;</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then smerk'd at the ladies, they simper'd all round,</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Touch'd their lips with their fans, — Mrs. Consequence frown'd.</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The simper subsided, for she with her nods,</l>
     <l n="37" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Awes these lower assemblies, as Jove awes the gods.</l>
     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She smil'd on Miss Rhymer, and bad her proceed —</l>
     <l n="39" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says she, there are various subjects indeed:</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With some little pleasure I read all the rest,</l>
     <l n="41" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But the Murder of Amnon's the longest and best.</l>
     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Of Amnon, of Amnon, Miss Rhymer, who's he?</l>
     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His name, says Miss Gaiety's quite new to me: —</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis a Scripture tale, ma'am, — he's the son of King David,</l>
     <l n="45" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says a Reverend old Rector: quoth madam, I have it;</l>
     <l n="46" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A Scripture tale? — ay — I remember it — true;</l>
     <l n="47" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Pray is it i'th' old Testament or the new?</l>
     <l n="48" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">If I thought I could readily find it, I'd borrow</l>
     <l n="49" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">My house-keeper's Bible, and read it to-morrow.</l>
     <l n="50" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis in Samuel, ma'am, says the Rector: — Miss Gaiety</l>
     <l n="51" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Bow'd, and the Reverend blush'd for the laity.</l>
     <l n="52" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">You've read it, I find, says Miss Harriot Anderson;</l>
     <l n="53" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Pray, sir, is it any thing like Sir Charles Grandison?</l>
     <l n="54" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">How you talk, says Miss Belle, how should such a girl write</l>
     <l n="55" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A novel, or any thing else that's polite?</l>
     <l n="56" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">You'll know better in time, Miss: — She was but fifteen:</l>
     <l n="57" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Her mamma was confus'd — with a little chagrin,</l>
     <l n="58" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says, — Where's your attention, child? did not you hear</l>
     <l n="59" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Miss Rhymer say, that it was poems, my dear?</l>
     <l n="60" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Sir Timothy Turtle, my daughters ne'er look</l>
     <l n="61" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In any thing else but a cookery book:</l>
     <l n="62" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The properest study for women design'd;</l>
     <l n="63" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Mrs. Domestic, I'm quite of your mind.</l>
     <l n="64" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Your haricoes, ma'am, are the best I e'er eat,</l>
     <l n="65" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says the Knight, may I venture to beg a receipt.</l>
     <l n="66" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis much at your service, says madam, and bow'd,</l>
     <l n="67" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then flutter'd her fan, of the compliment proud.</l>
     <l n="68" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Lady Jane Rational, the bill of fare</l>
     <l n="69" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Is th' utmost extent of my cookery care:</l>
     <l n="70" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Most servants can cook for the palate I find,</l>
     <l n="71" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But very few of them can cook for the mind.</l>
     <l n="72" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who, says Lady Pedigree, can this girl be;</l>
     <l n="73" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Perhaps she's descended of some family; —</l>
     <l n="74" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Of family, doubtless, says Captain Bonair,</l>
     <l n="75" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She's descended from Adam, I'd venture to swear.</l>
     <l n="76" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Her Ladyship drew herself up in her chair,</l>
     <l n="77" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And twitching her fan-sticks, affected a sneer.</l>
     <l n="78" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I know something of her, says Mrs. Devoir,</l>
     <l n="79" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She liv'd with my friend, Jacky Faddle, Esq.</l>
     <l n="80" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis sometime ago though; her mistress said then,</l>
     <l n="81" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The girl was excessively fond of a pen;</l>
     <l n="82" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I saw her, but never convers'd with her —</l>
     <l n="83" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">One can't make acquaintance with servants, you know.</l>
     <l n="84" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis pity the girl was not bred in high life,</l>
     <l n="85" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Mr. Fribbello: — yes, — then, says his wife,</l>
     <l n="86" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She doubtless might have wrote something worth notice:</l>
     <l n="87" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis pity, says one, — says another, and so 'tis.</l>
     <l n="88" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">O law! says young Seagram, I've seen the book, now</l>
     <l n="89" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I remember, there's something about a mad cow.</l>
     <l n="90" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A mad cow! — ha, ha, ha, ha, return'd half the room;</l>
     <l n="91" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What can y' expect better, says Madam Du Bloom?</l>
     <l n="92" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">They look at each other, — a general pause —</l>
     <l n="93" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And Miss Coquettella adjusted her gauze.</l>
     <l n="94" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The Rector reclin'd himself back in his chair,</l>
     <l n="95" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And open'd his snuff-box with indolent air;</l>
     <l n="96" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">This book, says he, (snift, snift) has in the beginning,</l>
     <l n="97" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">(The ladies give audience to hear his opinion)</l>
     <l n="98" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Some pieces, I think, that are pretty correct;</l>
     <l n="99" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A stile elevated you cannot expect:</l>
     <l n="100" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To some of her equals they may be a treasure,</l>
     <l n="101" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And country lasses may read 'em with pleasure.</l>
     <l n="102" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That Amnon, you can't call it poetry neither,</l>
     <l n="103" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">There's no flights of fancy, or imagery either;</l>
     <l n="104" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">You may stile it prosaic, blank-verse at the best;</l>
     <l n="105" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Some pointed reflections, indeed, are exprest;</l>
     <l n="106" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The narrative lines are exceedingly poor:</l>
     <l n="107" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Her Jonadab is a — the drawing-room door</l>
     <l n="108" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Was open'd, the gentlemen came from below,</l>
     <l n="109" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And gave the discourse a definitive blow.</l>
