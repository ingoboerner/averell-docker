     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The how d'ye's were over, and entering bustle,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The company seated, and silks ceas'd to rustle:</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The great Mrs. Consequence open'd her fan;</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And thus the discourse in an instant began:</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">(All affected reserve, and formality scorning,)</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I suppose you all saw in the paper this morning,</l>
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A Volume of Poems advertis'd — 'tis said</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">They're produc'd by the pen of a poor Servant Maid.</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A servant write verses! says Madam Du Bloom;</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Pray what is the subject? — a Mop, or a Broom?</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He, he, he, — says Miss Flounce; I suppose we shall see</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">An Ode on a Dishclout — what else can it be?</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Miss Coquettilla, why ladies so tart?</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Perhaps Tom the Footman has fired her heart;</l>
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And she'll tell us how charming he looks in new clothes,</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And how nimble his hand moves in brushing the shoes;</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Or how the last time that he went to May-Fair,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He bought her some sweethearts of ginger-bread ware.</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For my part I think, says old lady Marr-joy,</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A servant might find herself other employ:</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Was she mine I'd employ her as long as 'twas light,</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And send her to bed without candle at night.</l>
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Why so? says Miss Rhymer, displeas'd; I protest</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis pity a genius should be so deprest!</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What ideas can such low-bred creatures conceive,</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Mrs. Noworthy, and laught in her sleeve.</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says old Miss Prudella, if servants can tell</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">How to write to their mothers, to say they are well,</l>
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And read of a Sunday the Duty of Man;</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Which is more I believe than one half of them can;</l>
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I think 'tis much  they should rest there,</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Than be reaching at things so much out of their sphere.</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says old Mrs. Candour, I've now got a maid</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That's the plague of my life — a young gossipping jade;</l>
     <l n="37" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">There's no end of the people that after her come,</l>
     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And whenever I'm out, she is never at home;</l>
     <l n="39" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I'd rather ten times she would sit down and write,</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Than gossip all over the town ev'ry night.</l>
     <l n="41" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Some whimsical trollop most like, says Miss Prim,</l>
     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Has been scribbling of nonsense, just out of a whim,</l>
     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And conscious it neither is witty or pretty,</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Conceals her true name, and ascribes it to Betty.</l>
     <l n="45" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I once had a servant myself, says Miss Pines,</l>
     <l n="46" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That wrote on a Wedding, some very good lines;</l>
     <l n="47" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Mrs. Domestic, and when they were done,</l>
     <l n="48" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I can't see for my part, what use they were</l>
     <l n="49" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Had she wrote a receipt, to've instructed you how</l>
     <l n="50" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To warm a cold breast of veal, like a ragou,</l>
     <l n="51" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Or to make cowslip wine, that would pass for Champaign;</l>
     <l n="52" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">It might have been useful, again and again.</l>
     <l n="53" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">On the sofa was old lady Pedigree plac'd,</l>
     <l n="54" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She own'd that for poetry she had no taste,</l>
     <l n="55" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That the study of heraldry was more in fashion,</l>
     <l n="56" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And boasted she knew all the crests in the nation.</l>
     <l n="57" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Mrs. Routella, — Tom, take out the urn,</l>
     <l n="58" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And stir up the fire, you see it don't burn.</l>
     <l n="59" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The tea things remov'd, and the tea-table gone,</l>
     <l n="60" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The card-tables brought, and the cards laid thereon,</l>
     <l n="61" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The ladies ambitious for each others crown,</l>
     <l n="62" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Like courtiers contending for honours sat down.</l>
