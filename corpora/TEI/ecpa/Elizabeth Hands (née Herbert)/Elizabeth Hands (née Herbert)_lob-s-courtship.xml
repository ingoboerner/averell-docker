     <l n="1" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Lob among his cows one day,</l>
     <l n="2" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Was filling of their cribs with hay;</l>
     <l n="3" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">As he to th' crib the hay did carry,</l>
     <l n="4" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">It came into his head to marry;</l>
     <l n="5" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Says he, there's little merry Nell,</l>
     <l n="6" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">I think I like her very well;</l>
     <l n="7" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">But she, perhaps, at me will scoff,</l>
     <l n="8" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Besides, she lives a great way off:</l>
     <l n="9" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">He mus'd a while, then judg'd it better,</l>
     <l n="10" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">The courtship to begin by letter;</l>
     <l n="11" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">So he a bit of paper found,</l>
     <l n="12" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">'Twas neither long, nor square, nor round;</l>
     <l n="13" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">It was the best that he could find,</l>
     <l n="14" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">And on it thus, he wrote his mind:</l>
     <l n="15" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Dear Nelly, I make bold to send</l>
     <l n="16" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">My love to you, and am your friend;</l>
     <l n="17" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">I think you are a pretty maid,</l>
     <l n="18" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">And wonder much that you don't wed;</l>
     <l n="19" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">If you can like a country man,</l>
     <l n="20" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">I'll come and see you, if I can,</l>
     <l n="21" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">When roads are good, and weather fine,</l>
     <l n="22" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">But first I hope you'll send a line.</l>
     <l n="23" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Then he in haste this letter sent,</l>
     <l n="24" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Also two apples did present,</l>
     <l n="25" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Which Nell receiv'd, and read the letter,</l>
     <l n="26" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">(But she lik'd the apples better);</l>
     <l n="27" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">When read she into the fire threw it,</l>
     <l n="28" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">And never sent an answer to it.</l>
     <l n="29" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">When spring drew on, the cuckow sung,</l>
     <l n="30" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">The roads were dry, and days were long,</l>
     <l n="31" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">The cows were all turn'd out to grass,</l>
     <l n="32" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Then Lob set out to see his lass;</l>
     <l n="33" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">He oil'd his shoes, and comb'd his hair,</l>
     <l n="34" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">As if a going to a fair:</l>
     <l n="35" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">He was a very clever clown,</l>
     <l n="36" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">His frock was of the sustian brown,</l>
     <l n="37" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">His stick was bended like a bow,</l>
     <l n="38" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">His handkerchief too made a show,</l>
     <l n="39" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">His hat stood like the pot-lid round,</l>
     <l n="40" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">So on he went, and Nell he found.</l>
     <l n="41" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">What Nelly! how dost do? says he,</l>
     <l n="42" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Come, will you go along with me</l>
     <l n="43" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">O'er yonder stile, a little way</l>
     <l n="44" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Along that close; Nell, what dost say?</l>
     <l n="45" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Me go with you o'er yonder stile?</l>
     <l n="46" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">Says Nell, indeed I can't a-while;</l>
     <l n="47" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">So she stept in, and shut the door,</l>
     <l n="48" met="-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="8">And he shabb'd off, and said no more.</l>
