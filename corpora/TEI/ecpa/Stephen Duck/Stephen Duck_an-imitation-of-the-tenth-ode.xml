    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">IF we, my Lord, with easy Strife,</l>
     <l n="2">Would pass this fickle Tide of Life;</l>
     <l n="3">We must not always rashly sail</l>
     <l n="4">With ev'ry light, inconstant Gale;</l>
     <l n="5">Nor yet, at ev'ry Surge that roars,</l>
     <l n="6">Too tim'rous, seek the craggy Shores.</l>
     <l n="7">The Man who keeps the</l>
     <l n="8">Where raging Storms are seldom seen,</l>
     <l n="9">Avoids the dang'rous Rocks and Pools,</l>
     <l n="10">That fright the Wise, and swallow Fools:</l>
     <l n="11">He's ne'er despis'd among the Crowd,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor envy'd in the Court;</l>
     <l n="13">But steers between the Base and Proud,</l>
     <l n="14">To gain the peaceful Port.</l>
     <l n="15">While lofty Spires and Cedars fall,</l>
     <l n="16">Storm-beaten, to the Plain,</l>
     <l n="17">The lowly Shrub, and humble Wall,</l>
     <l n="18">Are Proof to Wind and Rain;</l>
     <l n="19">And Lightnings guiltless o'er the Cottage fly;</l>
     <l n="20">But smite th'ambitious Hills, that, tow'ring, threat the Sky.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="21">THE steady Mind, that's truly great,</l>
     <l n="22">Surveys, unmov'd, the Turns of Fate:</l>
     <l n="23">If Wealth and Fame his Pride increase,</l>
     <l n="24">His Fears their Force controul;</l>
     <l n="25">If adverse Fortune would depress,</l>
     <l n="26">Hope elevates his Soul:</l>
     <l n="27">Because he knows, the Pow'r who brings</l>
     <l n="28">The Winter with its dreary Wings,</l>
     <l n="29">Can make the vernal Beauties grow,</l>
     <l n="30">And turn our Woe to Bliss, or Bliss to Woe.</l>
     <l n="31">If now on anxious Cares you feed,</l>
     <l n="32">A Feast of Joy may soon succeed,</l>
     <l n="33">To chear your pensive Mind.</l>
     <l n="34">With Times, our Tempers vary round,</l>
     <l n="35">Nothing immutable is found,</l>
     <l n="36">But all to Change inclin'd.</l>
     <l n="37">Tho' POPE with Illness oft complains,</l>
     <l n="38">POPE is not always rack'd with Pains;</l>
     <l n="39">But, warm'd with PHOEBUS' Fire,</l>
     <l n="40">Sometimes he wakes the sleeping String,</l>
     <l n="41">Or bids the silent Muses sing,</l>
     <l n="42">And charms us with his Lyre.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="43">OUR Life's, at best, a chequer'd Scene</l>
     <l n="44">Of Health and Sickness, Mirth and Spleen:</l>
     <l n="45">Yet, since we all must stem this Sea,</l>
     <l n="46">Where Calm and Tempest dwell;</l>
     <l n="47">Grieve not to steer the destin'd Way,</l>
     <l n="48">But strive to pass it well:</l>
     <l n="49">If adverse Storms begin to rave,</l>
     <l n="50">Serenely view the foamy Wave,</l>
     <l n="51">Collected in yourself, and resolutely brave.</l>
     <l n="52">Or, if you find indulgent Gales</l>
     <l n="53">Impel the Bark too fast,</l>
     <l n="54">Wisely contract the swelling Sails,</l>
     <l n="55">And check their rapid Haste;</l>
     <l n="56">Lest, in your swift Career, the Ship</l>
     <l n="57">Split on a Rock, and sink beneath the Deep.</l>
