    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">BELIEVE me, Sir, your Cost and Cares,</l>
     <l n="2">Your Dogs and Locks, your Bolts and Bars,</l>
     <l n="3">Your Palisades, and Walls of Brass,</l>
     <l n="4">Are all too weak, when Gold attacks the Place.</l>
     <l n="5">A brazen Tow'r ACRISIUS rear'd;</l>
     <l n="6">A brazen Tow'r, he thought, would guard</l>
     <l n="7">His Daughter from the leach'rous Arms</l>
     <l n="8">Of those who nightly sought her Charms;</l>
     <l n="9">While surly Mastiffs watch'd the Dame,</l>
     <l n="10">And thund'ring, told if Lovers came:</l>
     <l n="11">These kept the Nymph from Gods and Men,</l>
     <l n="12">Not JOVE himself could enter in;</l>
     <l n="13">Till VENUS (wondrous to behold!)</l>
     <l n="14">Transform'd his Godship into Gold.</l>
     <l n="15">O STANLEY, STANLEY! Gold has Pow'r</l>
     <l n="16">The sternest Heart to move,</l>
     <l n="17">To burst the Wall, or pierce the Tow'r,</l>
     <l n="18">Impervious ev'n to JOVE.</l>
     <l n="19">Gold can the subtlest Head deceive,</l>
     <l n="20">Or Peace, or War can bring,</l>
     <l n="21">Buy Votes, raise  Arms, and give</l>
     <l n="22">The  a King.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="23">knew the Force of Gold,</l>
     <l n="24">When PHILIP's Martial Fate he thus foretold:</l>
     <l n="25">"The sharpest Lance of Steel may err,</l>
     <l n="26">" So may the surest Bow;</l>
     <l n="27">"But know, O King, the  Spear</l>
     <l n="28">" Will vanquish ev'ry Foe. "</l>
     <l n="29">The God's Advice the Prince pursu'd;</l>
     <l n="30">He fought with Gold, and Gold subdu'd:</l>
     <l n="31">Whence some Historians say, 'twas</l>
     <l n="32">And not young AMMON's Father, conquer'd</l>
     <l n="33">Gold has an absolute Command;</l>
     <l n="34">It rules at Sea, as well as Land:</l>
     <l n="35">For, when two adverse Fleets engage,</l>
     <l n="36">And firy Tubes displode their Rage;</l>
     <l n="37">A Bribe can make their Thunder cease,</l>
     <l n="38">And hush the wat'ry World to Peace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="39">Yet, notwithstanding all its Force,</l>
     <l n="40">It often brings the greatest Curse.</l>
     <l n="41">Vexatious Cares and Discontents</l>
     <l n="42">Increasing Gold attend;</l>
     <l n="43">Desires enlarge, as Wealth augments;</l>
     <l n="44">For Av'rice knows no End.</l>
     <l n="45">We labour up the golden Hill with Pain;</l>
     <l n="46">But ne'er surmount the tow'ring  of Gain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="47">O STANLEY, Honour of my Muse!</l>
     <l n="48">I fear, and justly fear,</l>
     <l n="49">To steer the Course Ambition shews,</l>
     <l n="50">Or soar beyond my Sphere.</l>
     <l n="51">He's poor, who always after Wealth aspires;</l>
     <l n="52">He's rich, who always curbs his own Desires.</l>
     <l n="53">I more admire an humble Seat,</l>
     <l n="54">Than all the Pomps, which vex the Great;</l>
     <l n="55">And from their gilded Roofs retire,</l>
     <l n="56">On  Banks to tune my Lyre.</l>
     <l n="57">In this Retreat I'm nobler bless'd,</l>
     <l n="58">Than CROESUS e'er could be,</l>
     <l n="59">Than if (like Misers) I possess'd</l>
     <l n="60">A</l>
     <l n="61">While favour'd by the Best of Queens,</l>
     <l n="62">Who all my Wants supplies;</l>
     <l n="63">While fragrant Groves, and flow'ry Scenes,</l>
     <l n="64">Delight my Muse's Eyes;</l>
     <l n="65">My Fate a far superior Blessing brings,</l>
     <l n="66">Than all the Pageantry of  Kings.</l>
     <l n="67">What tho' no Flocks, on  Plain,</l>
     <l n="68">With Fleeces deck my Pride?</l>
     <l n="69">What tho' I seldom drink</l>
     <l n="70">Or quaff the purple Tide?</l>
     <l n="71">If these I wanted, were your Bard to ask,</l>
     <l n="72">I know, your gen'rous Soul would send a</l>
     <l n="73">I make my Wants and Wealth agree;</l>
     <l n="74">I pay my Debts no worse than he,</l>
     <l n="75">Who o'er the Seas extends his Reign,</l>
     <l n="76">And adds all  to</l>
     <l n="77">Who covets most, is most in Need,</l>
     <l n="78">And always rides a restless Steed,</l>
     <l n="79">Which foams, and flies without Controul,</l>
     <l n="80">Still seeks, but ne'er obtains the Goal.</l>
     <l n="81">Then happy those, whom Heav'n has bless'd,</l>
     <l n="82">With what may Life sustain;</l>
     <l n="83">Nor are with pinching Want depress'd,</l>
     <l n="84">Nor curst with too much Gain:</l>
     <l n="85">For boundless Wealth ne'er fills a boundless Mind;</l>
     <l n="86">The Man who still pursues, is still behind.</l>
