    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">VIRTUE, stern Tutress, hail!</l>
     <l n="2">Hail thou, whose guidance trains</l>
     <l n="3">In life's rough paths the delegated youth;</l>
     <l n="4">Each thought, each enterprising deed arraigns</l>
     <l n="5">At the tribunal of impartial Truth:</l>
     <l n="6">What charms attractive grace thy modest mien,</l>
     <l n="7">Or in Religion's snow-white veil,</l>
     <l n="8">Or unstain'd robes of Honour drest;</l>
     <l n="9">Thy eye how bold, yet mild; how rigid, yet serene!</l>
     <l n="10">Thine, virgin, was the genial fire</l>
     <l n="11">That glow'd in each heroic breast;</l>
     <l n="12">And prompted to aspire,</l>
     <l n="13">On Merit's field to win an honour'd name</l>
     <l n="14">In the bright annals of distinguish'd fame:</l>
     <l n="15">Bade them the deathless crown of Glory seize;</l>
     <l n="16">The crown, that, cull'd from Labour's arduous grove,</l>
     <l n="17">The sister graces for his temples wove,</l>
     <l n="18">Who dar'd, amidst a loose and venal state,</l>
     <l n="19">Look down superior to th' alluring bait,</l>
     <l n="20">And spurn the sluggard bed of downy ease.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="21">O say, what soul-supporting thought</l>
     <l n="22">In that dread hour inspir'd th' Athenian sage;</l>
     <l n="23">When, victim to a faction's rage,</l>
     <l n="24">Unmov'd he quaff'd the fatal bowl:</l>
     <l n="25">Thy influence fortified his soul,</l>
     <l n="26">And tempered to his taste the bitter draught.</l>
     <l n="27">Robed in Religion's purer vest,</l>
     <l n="28">Whilst every heighten'd charm more fair appeared,</l>
     <l n="29">Martyrs thy consecrated form confessed.</l>
     <l n="30">Hail'd Truth's bright dictates, and thy power revered.</l>
     <l n="31">Nor lure, nor threats their fixt resolves could shake,</l>
     <l n="32">For thee they soared above the narrow views,</l>
     <l n="33">The scenes that more contracted minds amuse,</l>
     <l n="34">And smil'd amidst the tortures of the stake.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="35">Estrang'd from Pleasure's soft embrace,</l>
     <l n="36">Whoe'er aspires in Glory's race</l>
     <l n="37">By proof of many a noble deed</l>
     <l n="38">To win the prize for him decreed</l>
     <l n="39">Who Virtue's height attains;</l>
     <l n="40">His name the Muse, chaste Virtue's friend,</l>
     <l n="41">Shall bid, emblaz'd in purest strains,</l>
     <l n="42">To the bold arch of heaven ascend:</l>
     <l n="43">And whilst the golden numbers flow,</l>
     <l n="44">Where all the graces all their influence breathe;</l>
     <l n="45">Fair Fame with never-fading wreath</l>
     <l n="46">Shall deck his laurell'd brow.</l>
