    <lg n="1" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="1" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">LATE on an evening I chanced to roam,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The night it was dark, and the streets they were dirty;</l>
     <l n="3" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">It was to attend the lov'd Celia home,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Engag'd in a company jovial and hearty.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="5" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">I instantly hasten'd to put on my shield,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The shield of indiff'rence, perhaps you may know it;</l>
     <l n="7" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">Appriz'd of the danger attending the field,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I judg'd it a piece of high prudence to shew it.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="9" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">I went to the door of an elegant inn;</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I heard who was there, and was fearful to venture:</l>
     <l n="11" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">Hope to embolden me then did begin,</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And courage undaunted advis'd me to enter,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="13" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">I quickly stepp'd forward, but struck with amaze,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By imminent danger I then was surrounded:</l>
     <l n="15" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">Three handsome young damsels upon me did gaze,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And all of a sudden, alas! I was wounded.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="17" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">Their shafts were set right, and their arrows did fly;</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I scarce could distinguish from whom they came thickest.</l>
     <l n="19" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">By Cupid's assistance at last I did spy</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The person best tim'd in her motions, and quickest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="21" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">Each gesture was killing, and gave me surprise;</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I grop'd for my breast-plate, it from me was taken:</l>
     <l n="23" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">My shield of indiff'rence had left me likewise;</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">My courage did fail, and my heart it was shaken.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="25" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">Thus finding myself in a pitiful plight;</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A young maid so handsome I needs must admire:</l>
     <l n="27" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">I gave a deep sigh, and I bid them goodnight;</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">My only expedient was â€“ to retire.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="29" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">A little of absence effected the cure,</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">So happily I of my wounds did recover;</l>
     <l n="31" met="-+|--+|--+|-" line_length="9">But now at a distance to keep I'll be sure,</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And laugh at the fate of a vanquished lover.</l>
