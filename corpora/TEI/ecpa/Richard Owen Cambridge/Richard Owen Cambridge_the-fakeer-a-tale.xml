     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A FAKEER (a religious well known in the East,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Not much like a parson, still less like a priest)</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With no canting, no sly jesuitical arts,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Field-preaching, hypocrisy, learning, or parts;</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By a happy refinement in mortification,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Grew the oracle, saint, and the pope of his nation.</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But what did he do this esteem to acquire?</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Did he torture his head or his bosom with fire?</l>
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd?</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist?</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">No. His holiness rose to this sovereign pitch</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By the merit of running long nails in his breech.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A wealthy young Indian, approaching the shrine,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Thus in banter accosts the prophetic divine.</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">This tribute accept for your int'rest with FO,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Whom with torture you serve, and whose will you must know;</l>
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To your suppliant disclose his immortal decree;</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tell me which of the heav'ns is allotted for me.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With you in the thirtieth! you impudent rogue!</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Can such wretches as you give to madness a vogue!</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Though the priesthood of FO on the vulgar impose,</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By squinting whole years at the end of their nose,</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Though with cruel devices of mortification</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">They adore a vain idol of modern creation,</l>
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Does the God of the heav'ns such a service direct?</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Can his mercy approve a self-punishing sect?</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Will his wisdom be worship'd with chains and with nails?</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Or e'er look for his rites in your noses and tails?</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Come along to my house and these penances leave,</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Give your belly a feast, and your breech a reprieve.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">This reas'ning unhing'd each fanatical notion;</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And stagger'd our saint in his chair of promotion.</l>
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">At length with reluctance he rose from his seat:</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And resigning his nails and his fame for retreat,</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Two weeks his new life he admir'd and enjoy'd:</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The third he with plenty and quiet was cloy'd.</l>
     <l n="37" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To live undistinguish'd to him was the pain,</l>
     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">An existence unnotic'd he could not sustain.</l>
     <l n="39" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In retirement he sigh'd for the fame-giving chair:</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For the crowd to admire him, to rev'rence and stare:</l>
     <l n="41" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">No endearments of pleasure and ease could prevail;</l>
     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He the saintship resum'd, and new larded his tail.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Our FAKEER represents all the vot'ries of fame;</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Their ideas, their means, and their end is the same:</l>
     <l n="45" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The sportsman, the buck; all the heroes of vice,</l>
     <l n="46" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With their gallantry, lewdness, the bottle and dice;</l>
     <l n="47" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The poets, the critics, the metaphysicians,</l>
     <l n="48" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The courtier, the patriot, all politicians;</l>
     <l n="49" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The statesman begirt with th' importunate ring,</l>
     <l n="50" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">(I had almost compleated my list with the king)</l>
     <l n="51" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All labour alike to illustrate my tale;</l>
     <l n="52" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All tortur'd by choice with th' invisible nail.</l>
