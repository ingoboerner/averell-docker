     <l n="1" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">was pensively walking one day,</l>
     <l n="2" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">Three pretty tight lasses he met in his way:</l>
     <l n="3" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">And who should they be, that were taking the air,</l>
     <l n="4" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">But , and , and  so fair.</l>
     <l n="5" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">The swain, who to beauty had never been blind,</l>
     <l n="6" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">Thought this was the season to tell 'em his mind:</l>
     <l n="7" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">But first he debated, to which lovely lass</l>
     <l n="8" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">He should offer his tenders, and open his case.</l>
     <l n="9" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">That  was pretty he could not deny,</l>
     <l n="10" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">But , he thought, had the sprightliest eye;</l>
     <l n="11" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">So on her his affections they rested awhile,</l>
     <l n="12" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">'Till  appear'd, with a look and a smile:</l>
     <l n="13" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">With a look and a smile which sure mischief had done,</l>
     <l n="14" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">Had the swain been encounter'd by  alone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="15" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">Perplext in his thought, and disturb'd in his breast,</l>
     <l n="16" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">And unable to tell which bright lass he lov'd best;</l>
     <l n="17" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">He folded his arms, to the grove he retir'd,</l>
     <l n="18" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">And decently on the green willow expir'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="19" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">To  sad fate lend a pitying ear,</l>
     <l n="20" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">For three at a time what poor mortal could bear?</l>
     <l n="21" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">One alone, trust me , had made him rejoice,</l>
     <l n="22" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">And the swain been quite happy — "With what?"</l>
     <l n="23" met="-+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="11">—  choice.</l>
