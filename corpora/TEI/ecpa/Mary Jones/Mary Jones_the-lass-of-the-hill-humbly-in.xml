     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">the brow of a Hill a young Shepherdess dwelt,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who no pangs of ambition or love had e'er felt:</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For a few sober maxims still ran in her head,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That'twas better to earn, ere she eat her brown bread:</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That to rise with the lark was conducive to health,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And, to folks in a cottage, contentment was wealth.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Now young , who liv'd in the valley below,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who at Church and at Market was reckon'd a Beau;</l>
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Had many times try'd o'er her heart to prevail,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And would rest on his pitch-fork to tell her his tale:</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With his winning behaviour he melted her heart;</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But, quite artless herself, she suspected no art.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He had sigh'd and protested, had kneel'd and implor'd,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And could lye with the grandeur and air of a Lord:</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then her eyes he commended in language well drest,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And enlarg'd on the torments that troubled his breast;</l>
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Till his sighs and his tears had so wrought on her mind '</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That in downright compassion to love she inclin'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But as soon as he'd melted the ice of her breast,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All the flames of his Love in a moment decreast;</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And at noon he goes flaunting all over the vale,</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Where he boasts of his conquest to  and</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tho' he sees her but seldom, he's always in haste,</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And if ever he mentions her, makes her his jest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All the day she goes sighing, and hanging her head,</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And her thoughts are so pester'd, she scarce earns her bread;</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The whole village cry  when a milking she goes,</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That so little affection is shew'd to the cows:</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But she heeds not their railing, e'en let 'em rail on,</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And a fig for the cows, now her sweet-heart is gone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Now beware, ye young Virgins of  gay isle,</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">How ye yield up your hearts to a look and a smile:</l>
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For  is artful, and Virgins are frail,</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And you'll find a false  in every vale,</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who to court you, and tempt you will try all his skill;</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But remember</l>
