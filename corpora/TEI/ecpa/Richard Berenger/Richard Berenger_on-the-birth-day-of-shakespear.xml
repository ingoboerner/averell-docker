     <l n="1">— PEACE to this meeting,</l>
     <l n="2">Joy and fair time, health and good wishes!</l>
     <l n="3">Now, worthy friends, the cause why we are met,</l>
     <l n="4">Is in celebration of the day that gave</l>
     <l n="5">Immortal  to this favour'd isle,</l>
     <l n="6">The most replenished sweet work of nature,</l>
     <l n="7">Which from the prime creation e'er she fram'd.</l>
     <l n="8">O thou divinest nature! how thyself thou blazon'st</l>
     <l n="9">In this thy son! form'd in thy prodigality,</l>
     <l n="10">To hold thy mirror up, and give the time,</l>
     <l n="11">Its very form and pressure! When he speaks</l>
     <l n="12">Each aged ear plays truant at his tales,</l>
     <l n="13">And younger hearings are quite ravished,</l>
     <l n="14">So voluble is his discourse — Gentle</l>
     <l n="15">As Zephyr blowing underneath the violet,</l>
     <l n="16">Not wagging its sweet head — yet as rough,</l>
     <l n="17">(His noble blood enchaff'd) as the rude wind,</l>
     <l n="18">That by the top doth take the mountain pine,</l>
     <l n="19">And make him stoop to th' vale. — 'Tis wonderful</l>
     <l n="20">That an invisible instinct should frame him</l>
     <l n="21">To Royalty, unlearn'd; honour untaught;</l>
     <l n="22">Civility not seen in other; knowledge</l>
     <l n="23">That wildly grows in him, but yields a crop</l>
     <l n="24">As if it had been sown. What a piece of work!</l>
     <l n="25">How noble in faculty! infinite in reason!</l>
     <l n="26">A combination and a form indeed,</l>
     <l n="27">Where every God did seem to set his seal.</l>
     <l n="28">Heav'n has him now — yet let our idolatrous fancy</l>
     <l n="29">Still sanctify his relicts; and this day</l>
     <l n="30">Stand aye distinguish'd in the kalendar</l>
     <l n="31">To the last syllable of recorded time:</l>
     <l n="32">For if we take him but for all in all</l>
     <l n="33">We ne'er shall look upon his like again.</l>
