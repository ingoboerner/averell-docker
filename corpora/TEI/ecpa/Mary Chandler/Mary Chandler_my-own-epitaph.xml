     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">lies a true Maid, deformed and old;</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who, that she never was handsome, ne'er needed be told.</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tho' she ne'er had a Lover, much Friendship had met;</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And thought all Mankind quite out of her Debt.</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She ne'er could forgive, for she ne'er had resented;</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">As she ne'er had deny'd, so she never repented.</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She lov'd the whole Species, but some had distinguish'd;</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But Time and much Thought had all Passion extinguish'd.</l>
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tho' not fond of her Station, content with her Lot;</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A Favour receiv'd she had never forgot.</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She rejoic'd in the Good that her Neighbour possess'd,</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And Piety, Purity, Truth she profess'd.</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">She liv'd in much Peace, but ne'er courted Pleasure;</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Her Book and her Pen had her Moments of Leisure.</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Pleas'd with Life, fond of Health, yet fearless of Death;</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Believing she lost not her Soul with her Breath.</l>
