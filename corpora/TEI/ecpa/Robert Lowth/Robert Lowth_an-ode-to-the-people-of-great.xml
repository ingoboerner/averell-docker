    <lg n="1" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="1">BRITON! the thunder of the wrath divine,</l>
     <l n="2">Due to thy fathers crimes, and long with-held from thine,</l>
     <l n="3">Shall burst with tenfold rage on thy devoted head;</l>
     <l n="4">Unless with conscious terrors aw'd,</l>
     <l n="5">By meek, heart-struck repentance led,</l>
     <l n="6">Suppliant thou fall before th' offended God:</l>
     <l n="7">If haply yet thou may'st avert his ire;</l>
     <l n="8">And stay his arm out-stretch'd to launce the avenging fire.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="9">Did not high God of old ordain,</l>
     <l n="10">When to thy grasp he gave the scepter of the main,</l>
     <l n="11">That empire in this favour'd land,</l>
     <l n="12">Fix'd on religion's solid base should stand?</l>
     <l n="13">When from thy struggling neck he broke</l>
     <l n="14">Th' inglorious, galling, papal yoke,</l>
     <l n="15">Humbled the pride of haughty Spain,</l>
     <l n="16">And free'd thee by a woman-hero's hand;</l>
     <l n="17">He then confirm'd the strong degree:</l>
     <l n="18">"Briton, be virtuous and be free;</l>
     <l n="19">"Be truth, be sanctity thy guide:</l>
     <l n="20">"Be humble: fear thy God; and fear thou none beside."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="21">Oft has th' offended Pow'r his rising anger shown:</l>
     <l n="22">Led on by his avenging hand</l>
     <l n="23">Rebellion triumphs in the land:</l>
     <l n="24">Twice have her barbarous sons our war-train'd hosts o'er.</l>
     <l n="25">They fell a cheap inglorious prey;</l>
     <l n="26">Th' ambitious victor's boast was half supprest,</l>
     <l n="27">While heav'n-bred fear, and wild dismay,</l>
     <l n="28">Unman'd the warrior's heart, and reign'd in every breast.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="29">Her arms to foreign lands Britannia bore;</l>
     <l n="30">Her arms, auspicious now no more!</l>
     <l n="31">With frequent conquests where the fires were crown'd;</l>
     <l n="32">The sons ill-fated fell, and bit the hostile ground:</l>
     <l n="33">The tame, war-trading Belgian fled,</l>
     <l n="34">While in his cause the Briton bled:</l>
     <l n="35">The Gaul stood wond'ring at his own success;</l>
     <l n="36">Oft did his hardiest bands their wonted fears confess,</l>
     <l n="37">Struck with dismay, and meditating flight;</l>
     <l n="38">While the brave foe still urg'd th' unequal fight,</l>
     <l n="39">While WILLIAM, with his Father's ardour fir'd,</l>
     <l n="40">Through all th' undaunted host the generous flame inspir'd!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="41">But heavier far the weight of shame</l>
     <l n="42">That sunk Britannia's naval fame:</l>
     <l n="43">In vain she spreads her once-victorious sails;</l>
     <l n="44">Or fear, or rashness; in her chiefs prevails;</l>
     <l n="45">And wildly these prevent, those basely shun the fight;</l>
     <l n="46">Content with humble praise, the foe</l>
     <l n="47">Avoids the long impending blow;</l>
     <l n="48">Improves the kind escape, and triumphs in his flight.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="49">The monstrous age, which still increasing years debase,</l>
     <l n="50">Which teems with unknown crimes, and genders new disgrace,</l>
     <l n="51">First, unrestrained by honour, faith; or shame,</l>
     <l n="52">Confounding every sacred name,</l>
     <l n="53">The hallow'd nuptial bed with lawless lust profan'd:</l>
     <l n="54">Deriv'd from this polluted source</l>
     <l n="55">The dire corruption held its course</l>
     <l n="56">Through the whole canker'd race, and tainted all the land.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="57">The rip'ning maid is vers'd in every dangerous art,</l>
     <l n="58">That ill adorns the form while it corrupts the heart:</l>
     <l n="59">Practis'd to dress, to dance, to play,</l>
     <l n="60">In wanton mask to lead the way,</l>
     <l n="61">To move the pliant limbs, to roll the luring eye;</l>
     <l n="62">With folly's gayest partizans to vye</l>
     <l n="63">In empty noise and vain expence;</l>
     <l n="64">To celebrate with flaunting air</l>
     <l n="65">The midnight revels of the fair;</l>
     <l n="66">Studious of ev'ry praise, but virtue, truth, and sense.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="67">Thus lesson'd in intrigue her early thought improves,</l>
     <l n="68">Nor meditates in vain forbidden loves:</l>
     <l n="69">Soon the gay nymph in Cyprus' train shall rove</l>
     <l n="70">Free and at large amidst th' Idalian grove;</l>
     <l n="71">Or haply jealous of the voice of fame,</l>
     <l n="72">Mask'd in the matron's sober name,</l>
     <l n="73">With many a well-dissembled wile</l>
     <l n="74">The kind, convenient husband's care beguile:</l>
     <l n="75">More deeply vers'd in Venus' mystic lore,</l>
     <l n="76">Yet for such meaner arts too lofty and sublime,</l>
     <l n="77">The proud, high-born, patrician whore,</l>
     <l n="78">Bears unabash'd her front; and glories in her crime.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="79">Hither from city and from court</l>
     <l n="80">The votaries of love resort;</l>
     <l n="81">The rich, the great, the gay, and the severe;</l>
     <l n="82">The pension'd architect of laws;</l>
     <l n="83">The patriot, loud in virtue's cause;</l>
     <l n="84">Proud of imputed worth, the peer:</l>
     <l n="85">Regardless of his faith, his country, or his name,</l>
     <l n="86">He pawns his honour and estate;</l>
     <l n="87">Nor reckons at how dear a rate</l>
     <l n="88">He purchases disease, and servitude, and shame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="89">Not from such dastard sires, to every virtue lost,</l>
     <l n="90">Sprung the brave youth which Britain once could boast:</l>
     <l n="91">Who curb'd the Gaul's usurping sway,</l>
     <l n="92">Who swept th' unnumber'd hosts away,</l>
     <l n="93">In Agincourt, and Cressy's glorious plain;</l>
     <l n="94">Who dy'd the seas with Spanish blood,</l>
     <l n="95">Their vainly-vaunted fleets subdu'd,</l>
     <l n="96">And spread the mighty wreck o'er all the vanquish'd main.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="97">No; â€” 'twas a generous race, by worth transmissive known:</l>
     <l n="98">In their bold breast their fathers spirit glow'd:</l>
     <l n="99">In their pure veins  mothers virtue flow'd:</l>
     <l n="100">They made hereditary praise their own.</l>
     <l n="101">The sire his emulous offspring led</l>
     <l n="102">The rougher paths of fame to tread;</l>
     <l n="103">The matron train'd their spotless youth</l>
     <l n="104">In honour, sanctity, and truth;</l>
     <l n="105">Form'd by th' united parents care,</l>
     <l n="106">The sons, tho' bold, were wise; the daughters chaste, tho' fair.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12" stanza_type="quintet">
     <l n="107">How Time, all-wasting, ev'n the worst impairs,</l>
     <l n="108">And each foul age to dregs still fouler runs!</l>
     <l n="109">Our sires, more vicious ev'n than theirs,</l>
     <l n="110">Left us, still more degenerate heirs,</l>
     <l n="111">To spawn a baser brood of monster-breeding sons.</l>
