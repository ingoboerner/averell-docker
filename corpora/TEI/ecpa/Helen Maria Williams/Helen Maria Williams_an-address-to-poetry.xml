     <l n="1">envious crowds the summit view,</l>
     <l n="2">Where Danger with Ambition strays;</l>
     <l n="3">Or far, with anxious step, pursue</l>
     <l n="4">Pale Av'rice, thro' his winding ways;</l>
     <l n="5">The selfish passions in their train,</l>
     <l n="6">Whose force the social ties unbind,</l>
     <l n="7">And chill the love of human kind,</l>
     <l n="8">And make fond Nature's best emotions vain;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">O, ! O nymph most dear,</l>
     <l n="10">To whom I early gave my heart, —</l>
     <l n="11">Whose voice is sweetest to my ear</l>
     <l n="12">Of aught in nature or in art;</l>
     <l n="13">Thou, who canst all my breast controul,</l>
     <l n="14">Come, and thy harp of various cadence bring,</l>
     <l n="15">And long with melting music swell the string</l>
     <l n="16">That suits the present temper of my soul.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="17">O! ever gild my path of woe,</l>
     <l n="18">And I the ills of life can bear;</l>
     <l n="19">Let but thy lovely visions glow,</l>
     <l n="20">And chase the forms of real care;</l>
     <l n="21">O still, when tempted to repine</l>
     <l n="22">At partial Fortune's frown severe,</l>
     <l n="23">Wipe from my eyes the anxious tear,</l>
     <l n="24">And whisper that thy soothing joys are mine!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="25">When did my fancy ever frame</l>
     <l n="26">A dream of joy by thee unblest?</l>
     <l n="27">When first my lips pronounc'd thy name,</l>
     <l n="28">New pleasure warm'd my infant breast.</l>
     <l n="29">I lov'd to form the jingling rhyme,</l>
     <l n="30">The measur'd sounds, tho' rude, my ear could please,</l>
     <l n="31">Could give the little pains of childhood ease,</l>
     <l n="32">And long have sooth'd the keener pains of time.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="33">The idle crowd in fashion's train,</l>
     <l n="34">Their trifling comment, pert reply,</l>
     <l n="35">Who talk so much, yet talk in vain,</l>
     <l n="36">How pleas'd for thee, O nymph, I fly!</l>
     <l n="37">For thine is all the wealth of mind,</l>
     <l n="38">Thine the unborrow'd gems of thought;</l>
     <l n="39">The flash of light by souls refin'd,</l>
     <l n="40">From heav'n's empyreal source exulting caught.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="41">And ah! when destin'd to forego</l>
     <l n="42">The social hour with those I love, —</l>
     <l n="43">That charm which brightens all below,</l>
     <l n="44">That joy all other joys above,</l>
     <l n="45">And dearer to this breast of mine,</l>
     <l n="46">O Muse! than aught thy magic power can give, —</l>
     <l n="47">Then on the gloom of lonely sadness shine,</l>
     <l n="48">And bid thy airy forms around me live.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="49">Thy page, O ! let me view,</l>
     <l n="50">Thine! at whose name my bosom glows;</l>
     <l n="51">Proud that my earliest breath I drew</l>
     <l n="52">In that blest isle where  rose!</l>
     <l n="53">Where shall my dazzled glances roll?</l>
     <l n="54">Shall I pursue gay Ariel's flight?</l>
     <l n="55">Or wander where those hags of night</l>
     <l n="56">With deeds unnam'd shall freeze my trembling soul?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="57">Plunge me, foul sisters! in the gloom</l>
     <l n="58">Ye wrap around yon blasted heath:</l>
     <l n="59">To hear the harrowing rite I come,</l>
     <l n="60">That calls the angry shades from death!</l>
     <l n="61">Away — my frighted bosom spare!</l>
     <l n="62">Let true Cordelia pour her filial sigh,</l>
     <l n="63">Let Desdemona lift her pleading eye,</l>
     <l n="64">And poor Ophelia sing in wild despair!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="65">When the bright noon of summer streams</l>
     <l n="66">In one wide flash of lavish day,</l>
     <l n="67">As soon shall mortal count the beams,</l>
     <l n="68">As tell the powers of  lay!</l>
     <l n="69">O, Nature's Poet! the untaught,</l>
     <l n="70">The simple mind thy tale pursues,</l>
     <l n="71">And wonders by what art it views</l>
     <l n="72">The perfect image of each native thought.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="73">In those still moments, when the breast,</l>
     <l n="74">Expanded, leaves its cares behind,</l>
     <l n="75">Glows by some higher thought possest,</l>
     <l n="76">And feels the energies of mind;</l>
     <l n="77">Then, awful , raise the veil</l>
     <l n="78">That hides from human eye the heav'nly throng!</l>
     <l n="79">Immortal sons of light! I hear your song,</l>
     <l n="80">I hear your high-tun'd harps creation hail!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="81">Well might creation claim your care,</l>
     <l n="82">And well the string of rapture move,</l>
     <l n="83">When all was perfect, good, and fair,</l>
     <l n="84">When all was music, joy, and love!</l>
     <l n="85">Ere Evil's inauspicious birth</l>
     <l n="86">Chang'd Nature's harmony to strife;</l>
     <l n="87">And wild Remorse, abhorring life,</l>
     <l n="88">And deep Affliction, spread their shade on earth.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="89">Blest Poesy! O, sent to calm</l>
     <l n="90">The human pains which all must feel,</l>
     <l n="91">Still shed on life thy precious balm,</l>
     <l n="92">And every wound of nature heal!</l>
     <l n="93">Is there a heart of human frame</l>
     <l n="94">Along the burning track of torrid light,</l>
     <l n="95">Or 'mid the fearful waste of polar night,</l>
     <l n="96">That never glow'd at thy inspiring name?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="97">Ye Southern Isles, emerg'd so late</l>
     <l n="98">Where the Pacific billow rolls,</l>
     <l n="99">Witness, though rude your simple state,</l>
     <l n="100">How heav'n-taught verse can melt your souls!</l>
     <l n="101">Say, when you hear the wand'ring bard,</l>
     <l n="102">How thrill'd ye listen to his lay,</l>
     <l n="103">By what kind arts ye court his stay, —</l>
     <l n="104">All savage life affords his sure reward.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="105">So, when great  chiefs prepare,</l>
     <l n="106">Awhile from War's rude toils releas'd,</l>
     <l n="107">The pious hecatomb, and share</l>
     <l n="108">The flowing bowl, and genial feast:</l>
     <l n="109">Some heav'nly minstrel sweeps the lyre,</l>
     <l n="110">While all applaud the poet's native art;</l>
     <l n="111">For him they heap the viand's choicest part,</l>
     <l n="112">And copious goblets crown the Muse's fire.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="113">Ev'n , in scenes of pride and gain,</l>
     <l n="114">Where faint each genuine feeling glows;</l>
     <l n="115">, Nature asks, in want and pain,</l>
     <l n="116">The dear illusions verse bestows;</l>
     <l n="117">The poor, from hunger, and from cold,</l>
     <l n="118">Spare one small coin, the ballad's price,</l>
     <l n="119">Admire their poet's quaint device,</l>
     <l n="120">And marvel much at all his rhymes unfold.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16">
     <l n="121">Ye children, lost in forests drear,</l>
     <l n="122">Still o'er your wrongs each bosom grieves,</l>
     <l n="123">And long the red-breast shall be dear,</l>
     <l n="124">Who strew'd each little corpse with leaves;</l>
     <l n="125">For you my earliest tears were shed,</l>
     <l n="126">For you the gaudy doll I pleas'd forsook,</l>
     <l n="127">And heard, with hands uprais'd, and eager look,</l>
     <l n="128">The cruel tale, and wish'd ye were not dead!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17">
     <l n="129">And still on Scotia's northern shore,</l>
     <l n="130">"At times, between the rushing blast,"</l>
     <l n="131">Recording mem'ry loves to pour</l>
     <l n="132">The mournful song of ages past;</l>
     <l n="133">Come, lonely Bard "of other years!"</l>
     <l n="134">While dim the half-seen moon of varying skies,</l>
     <l n="135">While sad the wind along the grey moss sighs,</l>
     <l n="136">And give my pensive heart "the joy of tears!"</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18">
     <l n="137">The various tropes that splendour dart</l>
     <l n="138">Around the modern poet's line,</l>
     <l n="139">Where, borrow'd from the sphere of art,</l>
     <l n="140">Unnumber'd gay allusions shine,</l>
     <l n="141">Have not a charm my breast to please</l>
     <l n="142">Like the blue mist, the meteor's beam,</l>
     <l n="143">The dark-brow'd rock, the mountain stream,</l>
     <l n="144">And the light thistle waving in the breeze.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="19">
     <l n="145">Wild Poesy, in haunts sublime,</l>
     <l n="146">Delights her lofty note to pour;</l>
     <l n="147">She loves the hanging rock to climb,</l>
     <l n="148">And hear the sweeping torrent roar!</l>
     <l n="149">The little scene of cultur'd grace</l>
     <l n="150">But faintly her expanded bosom warms;</l>
     <l n="151">She seeks the daring stroke, the awful charms,</l>
     <l n="152">Which Nature's pencil throws on Nature's face.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="20">
     <l n="153">O, Nature! thou whose works divine</l>
     <l n="154">Such rapture in this breast inspire,</l>
     <l n="155">As makes me dream one spark is mine</l>
     <l n="156">Of Poesy's celestial fire;</l>
     <l n="157">When doom'd, "in cities pent," to leave</l>
     <l n="158">The kindling morn's unfolding view,</l>
     <l n="159">Which ever wears some aspect new,</l>
     <l n="160">And all the shadowy forms of soothing eve;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="21">
     <l n="161">Then, , then be ever near,</l>
     <l n="162">And paint whatever season reigns;</l>
     <l n="163">Still let me see the varying year,</l>
     <l n="164">And worship Nature in thy strains;</l>
     <l n="165">Now, when the wint'ry tempests roll,</l>
     <l n="166">Unfold their dark and desolating form,</l>
     <l n="167">Rush in the savage madness of the storm,</l>
     <l n="168">And spread those horrors that exalt my soul!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="22">
     <l n="169">And,  the music of thy verse</l>
     <l n="170">Shall winter's dreary gloom dispel,</l>
     <l n="171">And fond remembrance oft rehearse</l>
     <l n="172">The moral song she knows so well;</l>
     <l n="173">The sportive sylphs shall flutter here, —</l>
     <l n="174">There Eloise, in anguish pale,</l>
     <l n="175">"Kiss with cold lips the sacred veil,</l>
     <l n="176">" And drop with every bead too soft a tear! "</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="23">
     <l n="177">When disappointment's sick'ning pain</l>
     <l n="178">With chilling sadness numbs my breast,</l>
     <l n="179">That feels its dearest hope was vain,</l>
     <l n="180">And bids its fruitless struggles rest;</l>
     <l n="181">When those for whom I wish to live,</l>
     <l n="182">With cold suspicion wrong my aching heart;</l>
     <l n="183">Or, doom'd from those for ever lov'd to part,</l>
     <l n="184">And feel a sharper pang than death can give;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="24">
     <l n="185">Then with the mournful Bard I go,</l>
     <l n="186">Whom "melancholy mark'd her own,"</l>
     <l n="187">While tolls the curfew, solemn, slow,</l>
     <l n="188">And wander amid graves unknown;</l>
     <l n="189">With yon pale orb, lov'd poet, come!</l>
     <l n="190">While from those elms long shadows spread,</l>
     <l n="191">And where the lines of light are shed,</l>
     <l n="192">Read the fond record of the rustic tomb!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="25">
     <l n="193">Or let me o'er old Conway's flood</l>
     <l n="194">Hang on the frowning rock, and trace</l>
     <l n="195">The characters that, wove in blood,</l>
     <l n="196">Stamp'd the dire fate of  race;</l>
     <l n="197">Proud tyrant! tear thy laurell'd plume;</l>
     <l n="198">How poor thy vain pretence to deathless fame!</l>
     <l n="199">The injur'd Muse records thy lasting shame,</l>
     <l n="200">And she has power to "ratify thy doom."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="26">
     <l n="201">Nature, when first she smiling came,</l>
     <l n="202">To wake within the human breast</l>
     <l n="203">The sacred Muse's hallow'd flame,</l>
     <l n="204">And earth, with heav'n's rich spirit blest!</l>
     <l n="205">Nature in that auspicious hour,</l>
     <l n="206">With awful mandate, bade the Bard</l>
     <l n="207">The register of glory guard,</l>
     <l n="208">And gave him o'er all mortal honours power.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="27">
     <l n="209">Can Fame on Painting's aid rely?</l>
     <l n="210">Or lean on Sculpture's trophy'd bust? —</l>
     <l n="211">The faithless colours bloom to die,</l>
     <l n="212">The crumbling pillar mocks its trust;</l>
     <l n="213">But thou, O Muse, immortal maid!</l>
     <l n="214">Canst paint the godlike deeds that praise inspire,</l>
     <l n="215">Or worth, that lives but in the mind's desire,</l>
     <l n="216">In tints that only shall with Nature fade!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="28">
     <l n="217">O tell me, partial nymph! what rite,</l>
     <l n="218">What incense sweet, what homage true,</l>
     <l n="219">Draws from thy fount of purest light</l>
     <l n="220">The flame it lends a chosen few?</l>
     <l n="221">Alas! these lips can never frame</l>
     <l n="222">The mystic vow that moves thy breast;</l>
     <l n="223">Yet by thy joys my life is blest,</l>
     <l n="224">And my fond soul shall consecrate thy name.</l>
