    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">, winds of night! relentless tempests, rise!</l>
     <l n="2">Rush from the troubled clouds, and o'er me roll!</l>
     <l n="3">In this chill pause a deeper horror lies,</l>
     <l n="4">A wilder fear appals my shudd'ring soul! —</l>
     <l n="5">'Twas on this day, this hour accurst,</l>
     <l n="6">That Nature, starting from repose,</l>
     <l n="7">Heard the dire shrieks of murder burst —</l>
     <l n="8">From infant innocence they rose, —</l>
     <l n="9">And shook these solemn towers!</l>
     <l n="10">I shudd'ring pass that fatal room,</l>
     <l n="11">For ages wrapt in central gloom! —</l>
     <l n="12">I shudd'ring pass that iron door,</l>
     <l n="13">Which fate perchance unlocks no more;</l>
     <l n="14">Death, smear'd with blood, o'er the dark portal lowers!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="15">How fearfully my step resounds</l>
     <l n="16">Along these lonely bounds! —</l>
     <l n="17">Spare, savage blast! the taper's quiv'ring fires;</l>
     <l n="18">Deep in these gath'ring shades its flame expires.</l>
     <l n="19">Ye host of heaven! the door recedes —</l>
     <l n="20">It mocks my grasp — what unseen hands</l>
     <l n="21">Have burst its iron bands?</l>
     <l n="22">No mortal force this gate unbarr'd,</l>
     <l n="23">Where danger lives, which terrors guard —</l>
     <l n="24">Dread powers! its screaming hinges close</l>
     <l n="25">On this dire scene of impious deeds —</l>
     <l n="26">My feet are fix'd! — Dismay has bound</l>
     <l n="27">My step on this polluted ground!</l>
     <l n="28">But lo! the pitying moon a line of light</l>
     <l n="29">Athwart the horrid darkness dimly throws,</l>
     <l n="30">And from yon grated window chases night.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="31">Ye visions that before me roll,</l>
     <l n="32">That freeze my blood, that shake my soul!</l>
     <l n="33">Are ye the phantoms of a dream? —</l>
     <l n="34">Pale spectres! are ye what ye seem? —</l>
     <l n="35">They glide more near!</l>
     <l n="36">Their forms unfold!</l>
     <l n="37">Fix'd are their eyes — on me they bend —</l>
     <l n="38">Their glaring look is cold!</l>
     <l n="39">And hark! — I hear</l>
     <l n="40">Sounds that the throbbing pulse of life suspend:</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="41">"No wild illusion cheats thy sight</l>
     <l n="42">With shapes that only live in night —</l>
     <l n="43">Mark the native glories spread</l>
     <l n="44">Around my bleeding brow!</l>
     <l n="45">The crown of Albion wreath'd my head,</l>
     <l n="46">And Gallia's lilies twin'd below —</l>
     <l n="47">When my father shook his spear,</l>
     <l n="48">When his banner sought the skies,</l>
     <l n="49">Her baffled host recoil'd with fear,</l>
     <l n="50">Nor turn'd their shrinking eyes.</l>
     <l n="51">Soon as the daring eagle springs,</l>
     <l n="52">To bask in heav'n's empyreal light,</l>
     <l n="53">The vultures ply their baleful wings,</l>
     <l n="54">A cloud of deep'ning colour marks their flight,</l>
     <l n="55">Staining the golden day: —</l>
     <l n="56">But see! amid the rav'nous brood</l>
     <l n="57">A bird of fiercer aspect soar —</l>
     <l n="58">The spirits of a rival race</l>
     <l n="59">Hang on the noxious blast, and trace</l>
     <l n="60">With gloomy joy his destin'd prey;</l>
     <l n="61">Inflame th' ambitious wish that thirsts for blood,</l>
     <l n="62">And plunge his talons deep in kindred gore.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="63">"View the stern form that hovers nigh:</l>
     <l n="64">Fierce rolls his dauntless eye,</l>
     <l n="65">In scorn of hideous death;</l>
     <l n="66">Till starting at a brother's name,</l>
     <l n="67">Horror shrinks his glowing frame;</l>
     <l n="68">Locks the half-utter'd groan,</l>
     <l n="69">And chills the parting breath: —</l>
     <l n="70">Astonish'd Nature heav'd a moan!</l>
     <l n="71">When her affrighted eye beheld the hands</l>
     <l n="72">She form'd to cherish, rend her holy bands.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="73">"Look where a royal infant kneels;</l>
     <l n="74">Shrieking, and agoniz'd with fear,</l>
     <l n="75">He sees the dagger pointed near</l>
     <l n="76">A much-lov'd brother's breast,</l>
     <l n="77">And tells an absent mother all he feels!</l>
     <l n="78">His eager eye he casts around, —</l>
     <l n="79">Where shall her guardian form be found,</l>
     <l n="80">On which his eager eye would rest?</l>
     <l n="81">On her he calls in accents wild,</l>
     <l n="82">And wonders why her step is slow</l>
     <l n="83">To save her suff'ring child!</l>
     <l n="84">Rob'd in the regal garb, his brother stands</l>
     <l n="85">In more majestic woe,</l>
     <l n="86">And meets the impious stroke with bosom bare,</l>
     <l n="87">Then fearless grasps the murd'rer's hands,</l>
     <l n="88">And asks the minister of hell to spare</l>
     <l n="89">The child, whose feeble arms sustain</l>
     <l n="90">His bleeding form, from cruel death.</l>
     <l n="91">In vain fraternal fondness pleads,</l>
     <l n="92">For cold is now his livid cheek,</l>
     <l n="93">And cold his last, expiring breath;</l>
     <l n="94">And now, with aspect meek,</l>
     <l n="95">The infant lifts its mournful eye,</l>
     <l n="96">And asks, with trembling voice, to die,</l>
     <l n="97">If death will cure his heaving heart of pain!</l>
     <l n="98">His heaving heart now bleeds! —</l>
     <l n="99">Foul tyrant! o'er the gilded hour</l>
     <l n="100">That beams with all the blaze of power,</l>
     <l n="101">Remorse shall spread her thickest shroud!</l>
     <l n="102">The furies in thy tortur'd ear</l>
     <l n="103">Shall howl, with curses deep and loud,</l>
     <l n="104">And wake distracting fear!</l>
     <l n="105">I see the ghastly spectre rise,</l>
     <l n="106">Whose blood is cold, whose hollow eyes</l>
     <l n="107">Seem from his head to start! —</l>
     <l n="108">With upright hair and shiv'ring heart,</l>
     <l n="109">Dark o'er thy midnight couch he bends,</l>
     <l n="110">And clasps thy shrinking frame, thy impious spirit rends. "</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="111">Now his thrilling accents die —</l>
     <l n="112">His shape eludes my searching eye.</l>
     <l n="113">But who is he, convuls'd with pain,</l>
     <l n="114">That writhes in every swelling vein?</l>
     <l n="115">Yet in so deep, so wild a groan,</l>
     <l n="116">A sharper anguish seems to live</l>
     <l n="117">Than life's expiring pang can give! —</l>
     <l n="118">He dies deserted, and alone.</l>
     <l n="119">If pity can allay thy woes,</l>
     <l n="120">Sad spirit, they shall find repose:</l>
     <l n="121">Thy friend, thy long-lov'd friend is near;</l>
     <l n="122">He comes to pour the parting tear,</l>
     <l n="123">He comes to catch the parting breath.</l>
     <l n="124">Ah, heaven! no melting look he wears,</l>
     <l n="125">His alter'd eye with vengeance glares;</l>
     <l n="126">Each frantic passion at his soul;</l>
     <l n="127">'Tis he has dash'd that venom'd bowl</l>
     <l n="128">With agony and death!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="129">But whence arose that solemn call?</l>
     <l n="130">Yon bloody phantom waves his hand,</l>
     <l n="131">And beckons me to deeper gloom!</l>
     <l n="132">Rest, troubled form! I come —</l>
     <l n="133">Some unknown power my step impels</l>
     <l n="134">To horror's secret cells.</l>
     <l n="135">"For thee I raise this sable pall,</l>
     <l n="136">It shrouds a ghastly band:</l>
     <l n="137">Stretch'd beneath, thy eye shall trace</l>
     <l n="138">A mangled regal race!</l>
     <l n="139">A thousand suns have roll'd, since light</l>
     <l n="140">Rush'd on their solid night!</l>
     <l n="141">See, o'er that tender frame grim Famine hangs,</l>
     <l n="142">And mocks a mother's pangs!</l>
     <l n="143">The last, last drop which warm'd her veins</l>
     <l n="144">That meagre infant drains,</l>
     <l n="145">Then gnaws her fond, sustaining breast!</l>
     <l n="146">Stretch'd on her feeble knees, behold</l>
     <l n="147">Another victim sinks to lasting rest;</l>
     <l n="148">Another yet her matron arms would fold,</l>
     <l n="149">Who strives to reach her matron arms in vain —</l>
     <l n="150">Too weak her wasted form to raise,</l>
     <l n="151">On him she bends her eager gaze;</l>
     <l n="152">She sees the soft imploring eye</l>
     <l n="153">That asks her dear embrace, the cure of pain —</l>
     <l n="154">She sees her child at distance die!</l>
     <l n="155">But now her stedfast heart can bear,</l>
     <l n="156">Unmov'd, the pressure of despair.</l>
     <l n="157">When first the winds of winter urge their course</l>
     <l n="158">O'er the pure stream, whose current smoothly glides,</l>
     <l n="159">The heaving river swells its troubled tides;</l>
     <l n="160">But when the bitter blast with keener force</l>
     <l n="161">O'er the high wave an icy fetter throws,</l>
     <l n="162">The harden'd wave is fix'd in dead repose."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="163">"Say, who that hoary form? alone he stands,</l>
     <l n="164">And meekly lifts his wither'd hands;</l>
     <l n="165">His white beard streams with blood!</l>
     <l n="166">I see him with a smile deride</l>
     <l n="167">The wounds that pierce his shrivell'd side,</l>
     <l n="168">Whence flows a purple flood;</l>
     <l n="169">But sudden pangs his bosom tear —</l>
     <l n="170">On one big drop, of deeper dye,</l>
     <l n="171">I see him fix his haggard eye</l>
     <l n="172">In dark, and wild despair!</l>
     <l n="173">That sanguine drop which wakes his woe,</l>
     <l n="174">Say, Spirit! whence its source?"</l>
     <l n="175">"Ask no more its source to know —</l>
     <l n="176">Ne'er shall mortal eye explore</l>
     <l n="177">Whence flow'd that drop of human gore,</l>
     <l n="178">Till the starting dead shall rise,</l>
     <l n="179">Unchain'd from earth, and mount the skies,</l>
     <l n="180">And Time shall end his fated course.</l>
     <l n="181">Now th' unfathom'd depth behold:</l>
     <l n="182">Look but once — a second glance</l>
     <l n="183">Wraps a heart of human mould</l>
     <l n="184">In death's eternal trance!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="185">"That shapeless phantom, sinking slow</l>
     <l n="186">Deep down the vast abyss below,</l>
     <l n="187">Darts thro' the mists that shroud his frame,</l>
     <l n="188">A horror, nature hates to name!</l>
     <l n="189">Mortal, could thine eyes behold</l>
     <l n="190">All those sullen mists enfold,</l>
     <l n="191">Thy sinews at the sight accurst</l>
     <l n="192">Would wither, and thy heart-strings burst;</l>
     <l n="193">Death would grasp with icy hand,</l>
     <l n="194">And drag thee to our grizly band!</l>
     <l n="195">Away! the sable pall I spread,</l>
     <l n="196">And give to rest th' unquiet dead;</l>
     <l n="197">Haste! ere its horrid shroud enclose</l>
     <l n="198">Thy form, benumb'd with wild affright,</l>
     <l n="199">And plunge thee far through wastes of night,</l>
     <l n="200">In yon black gulph's abhorr'd repose!"</l>
     <l n="201">As, starting at each step, I fly,</l>
     <l n="202">Why backward turns my frantic eye,</l>
     <l n="203">That closing portal past?</l>
     <l n="204">Two sullen shades, half-seen, advance!</l>
     <l n="205">On me, a blasting look they cast,</l>
     <l n="206">And fix my view with dang'rous spells,</l>
     <l n="207">Where burning frenzy dwells! —</l>
     <l n="208">Again! their vengeful look — and now a speechless —</l>
