     <l n="1">AS once, if not with light regard,</l>
     <l n="2">I read aright that gifted Bard,</l>
     <l n="3">(Him whose school above the rest</l>
     <l n="4">His loveliest Elsin queen has blest)</l>
     <l n="5">One, only one, unrivall'd fair</l>
     <l n="6">Might hope the magic girdle wear,</l>
     <l n="7">At solemn turney hung on high,</l>
     <l n="8">The wish of each love-darting eye.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">Lo! to each other nymp in turn applied,</l>
     <l n="10">As if, in air unseen, some hovering hand,</l>
     <l n="11">Some chaste and angel-friend to virgin fame,</l>
     <l n="12">With whisper'd spell had burst the starting band,</l>
     <l n="13">It left unblest her loath'd dishonour'd side;</l>
     <l n="14">Happier, hopeless fair, if never</l>
     <l n="15">Her baffled hand with vain endeavour</l>
     <l n="16">Had touch'd that fatal zone to her denied!</l>
     <l n="17">Young Fancy thus, to me divinest name,</l>
     <l n="18">To whom, prepar'd and bath'd in heaven,</l>
     <l n="19">The cest of amplest power is given:</l>
     <l n="20">To few the god like gift assignt,</l>
     <l n="21">To gird their blest prophetic loins,</l>
     <l n="22">And gaze her visions wild, and feel unmix'd her flame.</l>
     <l n="23">The band, as fairy legends say,</l>
     <l n="24">Was wove on that creating day,</l>
     <l n="25">When he, who call'd with thought to birth</l>
     <l n="26">Yon tented sky, this laughing earth,</l>
     <l n="27">And drest with springs, and forests tall,</l>
     <l n="28">And pour'd the main engirting all,</l>
     <l n="29">Long by the lov'd enthusiast woo'd,</l>
     <l n="30">Himself in some diviner mood,</l>
     <l n="31">Retiring, sat with her alone,</l>
     <l n="32">And plac'd her on his saphire throne,</l>
     <l n="33">The whiles, the vaulted shrine around,</l>
     <l n="34">Seraphic wires were heard to sound!</l>
     <l n="35">Now sublimest triumph swelling,</l>
     <l n="36">Now on love and mercy dwelling;</l>
     <l n="37">And she, from out the veiling cloud,</l>
     <l n="38">Breath'd her magic notes aloud:</l>
     <l n="39">And thou, thou rich-hair'd youth of morn,</l>
     <l n="40">And all thy subject life was born!</l>
     <l n="41">The dangerous passions kept aloof,</l>
     <l n="42">Far from the sainted growing woof:</l>
     <l n="43">But near it sat ecstatic Wonder,</l>
     <l n="44">Listening the deep applauding thunder:</l>
     <l n="45">And Truth, in sunny vest array'd,</l>
     <l n="46">By whose the Tarsol's eyes were made:</l>
     <l n="47">All the shadowy tribes of Mind,</l>
     <l n="48">In braided dance their murmurs join'd,</l>
     <l n="49">And all the bright uncounted Powers,</l>
     <l n="50">Who feed on heaven's ambrosial flowers.</l>
     <l n="51">Where is the Bard, whose soul can now</l>
     <l n="52">Its high presuming hopes avow?</l>
     <l n="53">Where he who thinks, with rapture blind,</l>
     <l n="54">This hallow'd work for him design'd?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="55">High on some cliff, to heaven up-pil'd,</l>
     <l n="56">Of rude access, of prospect wild,</l>
     <l n="57">Where, tangled round the jealous steep,</l>
     <l n="58">Strange shades o'erbrow the vallies deep,</l>
     <l n="59">And holy Genii guard the rock,</l>
     <l n="60">Its glooms embrown, its springs unlock,</l>
     <l n="61">While on its rich ambitious head,</l>
     <l n="62">An Eden, like his own, lies spread.</l>
     <l n="63">I view that oak, the fancy'd glades among,</l>
     <l n="64">By which as Milton lay, his evening ear,</l>
     <l n="65">From many a cloud that dropp'd ethereal dew,</l>
     <l n="66">Nigh spher'd in heaven its native strains could hear:</l>
     <l n="67">On which that antient trump he reach'd was hung;</l>
     <l n="68">Thither of his glory greeting,</l>
     <l n="69">From Waller's myrtle shades retreating,</l>
     <l n="70">With many a vow from Hope's aspiring tongue,</l>
     <l n="71">My trembling feet his guiding steps pursue;</l>
     <l n="72">In vain â€” Such bliss to one alone,</l>
     <l n="73">Of all the sons of soul was known,</l>
     <l n="74">And Heaven, and Fancy, kindred powers,</l>
     <l n="75">Have now o'erturn'd th' inspiring bowers,</l>
     <l n="76">Or curtain'd close such scene from every future view.</l>
