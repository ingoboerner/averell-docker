    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">When he whom even our joys provoke,</l>
     <l n="2">The Fiend of Nature join'd his yoke,</l>
     <l n="3">And rush'd in wrath to make our isle his prey;</l>
     <l n="4">Thy form, from out thy sweet abode,</l>
     <l n="5">O'ertook him on his blasted road,</l>
     <l n="6">And stopp'd his wheels and look'd his rage away.</l>
     <l n="7">I see recoil his sable steeds,</l>
     <l n="8">That bore him swift to savage deeds,</l>
     <l n="9">Thy tender melting eyes they own;</l>
     <l n="10">O Maid, for all thy love to Britain shown,</l>
     <l n="11">Where Justice bars her iron tower,</l>
     <l n="12">To thee we build a roseate bower,</l>
     <l n="13">Thou, thou shalt rule our queen, and share our monarch's throne!</l>
