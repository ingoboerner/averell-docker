    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">WHO shall awake the Spartan fife,</l>
     <l n="2">And call in solemn sounds to life</l>
     <l n="3">The youths, whose locks divinely spreading,</l>
     <l n="4">Like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue,</l>
     <l n="5">At once the breath of fear and virtue shedding,</l>
     <l n="6">Applauding Freedom lov'd of old to view?</l>
     <l n="7">What new Alcaeus fancy-blest,</l>
     <l n="8">Shall sing the sword in myrtles drest,</l>
     <l n="9">At Wisdom's shrine awhile its flame concealing,</l>
     <l n="10">(What place so fit to seal a deed renown'd?)</l>
     <l n="11">Till she her brightest lightnings round revealing,</l>
     <l n="12">It leap'd in glory forth, and dealt her prompted wound!</l>
     <l n="13">O Goddess, in that feeling hour,</l>
     <l n="14">When most its sounds would court thy ears,</l>
     <l n="15">Let not my shell's misguided power</l>
     <l n="16">E'er draw thy sad, thy mindful tears.</l>
     <l n="17">No, Freedom, no, I will not tell,</l>
     <l n="18">How Rome, before thy weeping face,</l>
     <l n="19">With heaviest sound, a giant-statue, fell,</l>
     <l n="20">Push'd by a wild and artless race</l>
     <l n="21">From off its wide ambitious base,</l>
     <l n="22">When Time his northern sons of spoil awoke,</l>
     <l n="23">And all the blended work of strength and grace,</l>
     <l n="24">With many a rude repeated stroke,</l>
     <l n="25">And many a barbarous yell, to thousand fragments broke.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="26">Yet even, where'er the least appear'd,</l>
     <l n="27">Th' admiring world thy hand rever'd;</l>
     <l n="28">Still, 'midst the scatter'd states around,</l>
     <l n="29">Some remnants of her strength were found;</l>
     <l n="30">They saw, by what escap'd the storm,</l>
     <l n="31">How wonderous rose her perfect form;</l>
     <l n="32">How in the great, the labour'd whole,</l>
     <l n="33">Each mighty master pour'd his soul!</l>
     <l n="34">For sunny Florence, seat of art,</l>
     <l n="35">Beneath her vines preserv'd a part,</l>
     <l n="36">Till they, whom Science lov'd to name,</l>
     <l n="37">(O who could fear it i) quench'd her flame.</l>
     <l n="38">And lo, an humbler relic laid</l>
     <l n="39">In jealous Pisa's olive shade!</l>
     <l n="40">See small Marino joins the theme,</l>
     <l n="41">Tho' least, not last in thy esteem:</l>
     <l n="42">Strike, louder strike th' ennobling strings</l>
     <l n="43">To those, whose merchant sons were kings;</l>
     <l n="44">To him, who, deck'd with pearly pride,</l>
     <l n="45">In Adria weds his green-hair'd bride.</l>
     <l n="46">Hail port of glory, wealth, and pleasure,</l>
     <l n="47">Ne'er let me change this Lydian measure:</l>
     <l n="48">Nor e'er her former pride relate,</l>
     <l n="49">To sad Liguria's bleeding state.</l>
     <l n="50">Ah no! more pleas'd thy haunts I seek,</l>
     <l n="51">On wild Helvetia's mountains bleak:</l>
     <l n="52">(Where, when the favour'd of thy choice,</l>
     <l n="53">The daring archer heard thy voice;</l>
     <l n="54">Forth from his eyrie rous'd in dread,</l>
     <l n="55">The ravening eagle northward fled.)</l>
     <l n="56">Or dwell in willow'd meads more near.</l>
     <l n="57">With those to whom thy stork is dear:</l>
     <l n="58">Those whom the rod of Alva bruis'd,</l>
     <l n="59">Whose crown a British queen refus'd!</l>
     <l n="60">The magic works, thou feel'st the strains,</l>
     <l n="61">One holier name alone remains;</l>
     <l n="62">The perfect spell shall then avail,</l>
     <l n="63">Hail nymph, ador'd by Britain, hail!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="64">Beyond, the measure vast of thought,</l>
     <l n="65">The works, the wizzard Time has wrought!</l>
     <l n="66">The Gaul, 'tis held of antique story,</l>
     <l n="67">Saw Britain link'd to his now adverse strand,</l>
     <l n="68">No sea between, nor cliff sublime and hoary,</l>
     <l n="69">He pass'd with unwet feet thro' all our land.</l>
     <l n="70">To the blown Baltic then, they say,</l>
     <l n="71">The wild waves found another way,</l>
     <l n="72">Where Orcas howls, his wolfish mountains rounding;</l>
     <l n="73">Till all the banded West at once 'gan rise,</l>
     <l n="74">A wide wild storm even Nature's self confounding,</l>
     <l n="75">Withering her giant sons with strange uncouth surprise.</l>
     <l n="76">This pillar'd earth so firm and wide,</l>
     <l n="77">By winds and inward labours torn,</l>
     <l n="78">In thunders dread was push'd aside,</l>
     <l n="79">And down the should'ring billows born.</l>
     <l n="80">And see, like gems her laughing train,</l>
     <l n="81">The little isles on every side,</l>
     <l n="82">Mona, once hid from those who search the main,</l>
     <l n="83">Where thousand elsin shapes abide,</l>
     <l n="84">And Wight who checks the westering tide,</l>
     <l n="85">For thee consenting heaven has each bestow'd,</l>
     <l n="86">A fair attendant on her sovereign pride:</l>
     <l n="87">To thee this blest divorce she ow'd,</l>
     <l n="88">For thou hast made her vales thy lov'd, thy last abode!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="89">Then too, 'tis said, an hoary pile,</l>
     <l n="90">'Midst the green navel of our isle,</l>
     <l n="91">Thy shrine in some religious wood,</l>
     <l n="92">O soul-enforcing goddess, stood!</l>
     <l n="93">There oft the painted native's feet</l>
     <l n="94">Were wont thy form celestial meet:</l>
     <l n="95">Tho' now with hopeless toil we trace</l>
     <l n="96">Time's backward rolls, to find its place;</l>
     <l n="97">Whether the fiery-tressed Dane,</l>
     <l n="98">Or Roman's self o'erturn'd the fane,</l>
     <l n="99">Or in what heaven-left age it fell,</l>
     <l n="100">'Twere hard for modern song to tell.</l>
     <l n="101">Yet still, if Truth those beams infuse,</l>
     <l n="102">Which guide at once, and charm the Muse,</l>
     <l n="103">Beyond yon braided clouds that lie,</l>
     <l n="104">Paving the light-embroider'd sky:</l>
     <l n="105">Amidst the Bright pavillion'd plains,</l>
     <l n="106">The beauteous model still remains.</l>
     <l n="107">There happier than in islands blest,</l>
     <l n="108">Or bowers by Spring or Hebe drest,</l>
     <l n="109">The chiefs who fill our Albion's story,</l>
     <l n="110">In warlike weeds, retir'd in glory,</l>
     <l n="111">Hear their consorted Druids sing</l>
     <l n="112">Their triumphs to th' immortal string.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="113">How may the poet now unfold,</l>
     <l n="114">What never tongue or numbers told?</l>
     <l n="115">How learn delighted, and amaz'd,</l>
     <l n="116">What hands unknown that fabric rais'd!</l>
     <l n="117">Even now, before his favour'd eyes,</l>
     <l n="118">In Gothic pride it seems to rise!</l>
     <l n="119">Yet Graecia's graceful orders join,</l>
     <l n="120">Majestic thro' the mix'd design;</l>
     <l n="121">The secret builder knew to chuse,</l>
     <l n="122">Each sphere-found gem of richest hues:</l>
     <l n="123">Whate'er heaven's purer mould contains,</l>
     <l n="124">When nearer suns emblaze its veins;</l>
     <l n="125">There on the walls the patriot's sight</l>
     <l n="126">May ever hang with fresh delight,</l>
     <l n="127">And, grav'd with some prophetic rage,</l>
     <l n="128">Read Albion's same thro' every age.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="129">Ye forms divine, ye laureat band,</l>
     <l n="130">That near her inmost altar stand!</l>
     <l n="131">Now sooth her, to her blisssul train</l>
     <l n="132">Blythe Concord's social form to gain:</l>
     <l n="133">Concord, whose myrtle wand can steep</l>
     <l n="134">Even Anger's blood-shot eyes in sleep:</l>
     <l n="135">Before whose breathing bosom's balm,</l>
     <l n="136">Rage drops his steel, and storms grow calm;</l>
     <l n="137">Her let our sires and matrons hoar</l>
     <l n="138">Welcome to Britain's ravag'd shore,</l>
     <l n="139">Our youths, enamour'd of the fair,</l>
     <l n="140">Play with the tangles of her hair,</l>
     <l n="141">Till, in one loud applauding found,</l>
     <l n="142">The nations shout to her around,</l>
     <l n="143">O how supremely art thou blest,</l>
     <l n="144">Thou, Lady, thou shalt rule the west!</l>
