    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">, Derwent's beauteous pride!</l>
     <l n="2">Whose charms rough rocks in threatening grandeur guard,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose entrance seems to mortals barred,</l>
     <l n="4">But to the Genius of the storm thrown wide.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="5">He on thy rock's dread height,</l>
     <l n="6">Reclined beneath his canopy of clouds,</l>
     <l n="7">His form in darkness shrouds,</l>
     <l n="8">And frowns as fixt to keep thy beauties from the sight.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="9">But rocks and storms are vain:</l>
     <l n="10">Midst mountains rough and rude</l>
     <l n="11">Man's daring feet intrude,</l>
     <l n="12">Till, lo! upon the ravished eye</l>
     <l n="13">Burst thy clear stream, thy smiling sky,</l>
     <l n="14">Thy wooded valley, and thy matchless plain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="15">Bright vale! the Muse's choicest theme,</l>
     <l n="16">My morning thought, my midnight dream;</l>
     <l n="17">Still memory paints thee, smiling scene,</l>
     <l n="18">Still views the robe of purest green,</l>
     <l n="19">Refreshed by beauty-shedding rains,</l>
     <l n="20">Which wraps thy flower-enamelled plains;</l>
     <l n="21">Still marks thy mountains' fronts sublime,</l>
     <l n="22">Force graces from the hand of time;</l>
     <l n="23">Still I thy rugged rocks recall,</l>
     <l n="24">Which seem as nodding to their fall,</l>
     <l n="25">Whose wonders fixed my aching sight,</l>
     <l n="26">Till terror yielded to delight,</l>
     <l n="27">And my surprises, pleasures, fears,</l>
     <l n="28">Were told by slow delicious tears.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="29">But suddenly the smiling day</l>
     <l n="30">That cheered the valley, flies away;</l>
     <l n="31">The wooded rocks, the rapid stream,</l>
     <l n="32">No longer boast the noon-tide beam.</l>
     <l n="33">But storms athwart the mountains sail,</l>
     <l n="34">And darkly brood o'er Borrowdale.</l>
     <l n="35">The frightened swain his cottage seeks,</l>
     <l n="36">Ere the thick cloud in terror speaks: —</l>
     <l n="37">And see, pale lightning flashes round!</l>
     <l n="38">While as the thunder's awful sound</l>
     <l n="39">On Echo's pinion widely flies,</l>
     <l n="40">Yon cataract's roar unheeded dies; ....</l>
     <l n="41">And thee, Sublimity! I hail,</l>
     <l n="42">Throned on the gloom of Borrowdale.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="43">But soon the thunder dies away,</l>
     <l n="44">The flash withdraws its fearful ray;</l>
     <l n="45">Again upon the silver stream</l>
     <l n="46">Waves in bright wreaths the noon-tide beam.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="47">O scene sequestered, varied, wild,</l>
     <l n="48">Scene formed to soothe Affliction's child,</l>
     <l n="49">How blest were I to watch each charm</l>
     <l n="50">That decks thy vale in storm or calm!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="51">To see Aurora's hand unbind</l>
     <l n="52">The mists by night's chill power confined;</l>
     <l n="53">Upon the mountain's dusky brow</l>
     <l n="54">Then mark their colours as they flow,</l>
     <l n="55">Gliding the colder West to seek,</l>
     <l n="56">As from the East day's splendours break.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="57">Now the green plain enchants the sight,</l>
     <l n="58">Adorned with spots of yellow light;</l>
     <l n="59">While, by its magic influence, shade</l>
     <l n="60">With contrast seems each charm to aid,</l>
     <l n="61">And clothes the woods in deeper dyes,</l>
     <l n="62">To suit the azure-vested skies.</l>
     <l n="63">While, lo! the lofty rocks above,</l>
     <l n="64">Where proudly towers the bird of Jove;</l>
     <l n="65">See from the view yon radiant cloud</l>
     <l n="66">His broad and sable pinions shroud,</l>
     <l n="67">Till, as he onward wings his flight,</l>
     <l n="68">He vanishes in floods of light;</l>
     <l n="69">Where feathered clouds on æther sail,</l>
     <l n="70">And glittering hang o'er Borrowdale .....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="71">Or, at still midnight's solemn hour,</l>
     <l n="72">When the dull bat revolves no more,</l>
     <l n="73">In search of nature's awful grace,</l>
     <l n="74">I'd go, with slow and cautious pace,</l>
     <l n="75">Where the loud torrent's foaming tide</l>
     <l n="76">Lashes the rock's uneven side, ....</l>
     <l n="77">That rock which, o'er the stream below</l>
     <l n="78">Bending its moss-clad crumbling brow,</l>
     <l n="79">Makes pale with fear the wanderer's cheek,</l>
     <l n="80">Nor midnight's silence fails to break</l>
     <l n="81">By fragments from its aged head,</l>
     <l n="82">Which, rushing to the river's bed,</l>
     <l n="83">Cause, as they dash the waters round,</l>
     <l n="84">A dread variety of sound;</l>
     <l n="85">While I the gloomy grandeur hail,</l>
     <l n="86">And awe-struck rove through Borrowdale.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="87">Yes, scene sequestered, varied, wild,</l>
     <l n="88">So form'd to soothe Affliction's child,</l>
     <l n="89">Sweet Borrowdale! to thee I'll fly,</l>
     <l n="90">To hush my bosom's ceaseless sigh.</l>
     <l n="91">If yet in Nature's store there be</l>
     <l n="92">One kind heart-healing balm for me,</l>
     <l n="93">Now the long hours are told by sighs,</l>
     <l n="94">And sorrow steals health's crimson dyes, —</l>
     <l n="95">If aught can smiles and bloom restore,</l>
     <l n="96">Ah! surely thine's the precious power!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="97">Then take me to thy world of charms,</l>
     <l n="98">And hush my tortured breast's alarms;</l>
     <l n="99">Thy scenes with unobtrusive art</l>
     <l n="100">Shall steal the mourner from her heart, ....</l>
     <l n="101">The hands in sorrow claspt unclose,</l>
     <l n="102">Bid her sick soul on Heaven repose,</l>
     <l n="103">And, soothed by time and nature, hail</l>
     <l n="104">Health, peace, and hope in Borrowdale.</l>
