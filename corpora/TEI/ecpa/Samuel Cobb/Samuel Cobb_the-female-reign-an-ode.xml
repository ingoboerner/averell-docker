     <l n="1">WHAT can the British senate give,</l>
     <l n="2">To make the name of ANNA live,</l>
     <l n="3">By future people to be sung,</l>
     <l n="4">The labour of each grateful tongue?</l>
     <l n="5">Can faithful registers, or rhyme,</l>
     <l n="6">In charming eloquence, or sprightly wit,</l>
     <l n="7">The wonders of her reign transmit</l>
     <l n="8">To th' unborn children of succeeding time?</l>
     <l n="9">Can painters' oil, or statuaries' art,</l>
     <l n="10">Eternity to her impart?</l>
     <l n="11">No! titled statues are but empty things,</l>
     <l n="12">Inscrib'd to royal vanity,</l>
     <l n="13">The sacrifice of flattery</l>
     <l n="14">To lawless Neros, or Bourbonian kings.</l>
     <l n="15">True virtue to her kindred stars aspires,</l>
     <l n="16">Does all our pomp of stone and verse surpass,</l>
     <l n="17">And mingling with etherial fires,</l>
     <l n="18">No useless ornament requires</l>
     <l n="19">From speaking colours, or from breathing brass.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="nine-line">
     <l n="20">Greatest of princes! where the wand'ring sun</l>
     <l n="21">Does o'er earth's habitable regions roll,</l>
     <l n="22">From th' eastern barriers to the western goal,</l>
     <l n="23">And sees thy race of glory run</l>
     <l n="24">With swiftness equal to his own:</l>
     <l n="25">Thee on the banks of Flandrian Scaldis sings</l>
     <l n="26">The jocund swain releas'd from Gallic fear:</l>
     <l n="27">The English voice unus'd to hear,</l>
     <l n="28">Thee the repeating banks, thee ev'ry valley rings.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="29">The sword of heav'n how pious ANNA wields,</l>
     <l n="30">And heav'nly vengeance on the guilty deals,</l>
     <l n="31">Let the twice fugitive Bavarian tell;</l>
     <l n="32">Who, from his airy hope of better state,</l>
     <l n="33">By lust of sway irregularly great,</l>
     <l n="34">Like an apostate angel fell:</l>
     <l n="35">Who, by imperial favour rais'd,</l>
     <l n="36">I' th' highest rank of glory blaz'd:</l>
     <l n="37">And had till now unrivall'd shone,</l>
     <l n="38">More than a king contented with his own;</l>
     <l n="39">But Lucifer's bold steps he trod,</l>
     <l n="40">Who durst assault the throne of GOD;</l>
     <l n="41">And for contented realms of blissful light,</l>
     <l n="42">Gain'd the sad privilege to be</l>
     <l n="43">The first in solid misery,</l>
     <l n="44">Monarch of hell, and woes, and everlasting night.</l>
     <l n="45">Corruption of the best is always worst;</l>
     <l n="46">And foul ambition like an evil wind,</l>
     <l n="47">Blights the fair blossoms of a noble mind;</l>
     <l n="48">And if a seraph fall, he's doubly curst.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="49">Had guile, and pride, and envy grown</l>
     <l n="50">In the black groves of Styx alone,</l>
     <l n="51">Nor ever had on earth the baleful crop been sown:</l>
     <l n="52">The swain without amaze, had till'd</l>
     <l n="53">The Flandrian glebe, a guiltless field:</l>
     <l n="54">Nor had he wonder'd, when he found</l>
     <l n="55">The bones of heroes in the ground:</l>
     <l n="56">No crimson streams had lately swell'd</l>
     <l n="57">The Dyle, the Danube, and the Scheld.</l>
     <l n="58">But evils are of necessary growth,</l>
     <l n="59">To rouze the brave, and banish sloth;</l>
     <l n="60">And some are born to win the stars,</l>
     <l n="61">By sweat and blood, and worthy scars.</l>
     <l n="62">Heroick virtue is by action seen,</l>
     <l n="63">And vices serve to make it keen;</l>
     <l n="64">And as gigantick tyrants rise,</l>
     <l n="65">NASSAUS and CHURCHILLS leave the skies,</l>
     <l n="66">The earth-born monsters to chastise.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="67">If, heav'nly Muse, you burn with a desire</l>
     <l n="68">To praise the man whom all admire;</l>
     <l n="69">Come from thy learn'd Castalian springs,</l>
     <l n="70">And stretch aloft thy Pegasean wings:</l>
     <l n="71">Strike the loud Pindarick strings,</l>
     <l n="72">Like the lark who soars and sings;</l>
     <l n="73">And as you sail the liquid skies,</l>
     <l n="74">Cast on Menapian fields your weeping eyes:</l>
     <l n="75">For weep they surely must,</l>
     <l n="76">To see the bloody annual sacrifice;</l>
     <l n="77">To think how the neglected dust,</l>
     <l n="78">Which with contempt is basely trod,</l>
     <l n="79">Was once the limbs of captains, brave and just,</l>
     <l n="80">The mortal part of some great demi-god;</l>
     <l n="81">Who for thrice fifty years of stubborn war,</l>
     <l n="82">With slaught'ring arms, the gun and sword,</l>
     <l n="83">Have dug the mighty sepulchre,</l>
     <l n="84">And fell as martyrs on record,</l>
     <l n="85">Of tyranny aveng'd, and liberty restor'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="86">See, where at Audenard, with heaps of slain,</l>
     <l n="87">Th' heroick man inspir'dly brave,</l>
     <l n="88">Mowing across, bestrews the plain,</l>
     <l n="89">And with new tenants crowds the wealthy grave.</l>
     <l n="90">His mind unshaken at the frightful scene,</l>
     <l n="91">His looks as chearfully serene,</l>
     <l n="92">The routed battle to pursue,</l>
     <l n="93">As once adorn'd the Paphian queen,</l>
     <l n="94">When to her Thracian paramour she flew.</l>
     <l n="95">The gath'ring troops he kens from far,</l>
     <l n="96">And with a bridegroom's passion and delight,</l>
     <l n="97">Courting the war, and glowing for the fight,</l>
     <l n="98">The new Salmoneus meets the Celtic thunderer.</l>
     <l n="99">Ah, cursed pride! infernal dream!</l>
     <l n="100">Which drove him to this wild extream,</l>
     <l n="101">That dust a deity should seem;</l>
     <l n="102">Be thought, as through the wondering streets he rode,</l>
     <l n="103">A man immortal, or a god:</l>
     <l n="104">With rattling brass, and trampling horse,</l>
     <l n="105">Should counterfeit th' inimitable force</l>
     <l n="106">Of divine thunder: horrid crime!</l>
     <l n="107">But vengeance is the child of time,</l>
     <l n="108">And will too surely be repaid</l>
     <l n="109">On his profane devoted head,</l>
     <l n="110">Who durst affront the powers above,</l>
     <l n="111">And their eternal flames disgrace,</l>
     <l n="112">Too fatal, brandish'd by the real Jove,</l>
     <l n="113">Or Pallas, who assumes and fills his aweful place:</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="114">The British Pallas! who, as Homer's did</l>
     <l n="115">For her lov'd Diomede,</l>
     <l n="116">Her hero's mind with wisdom fills,</l>
     <l n="117">And heav'nly courage in his heart instils.</l>
     <l n="118">Hence thro' the thickest squadrons does he ride,</l>
     <l n="119">With ANNA'S angels by his side.</l>
     <l n="120">With what uncommon speed</l>
     <l n="121">He spurs his foaming, fiery steed,</l>
     <l n="122">And pushes on thro' midmost fires,</l>
     <l n="123">Where France's fortune, with her sons, retires!</l>
     <l n="124">Now here, now there, the sweeping ruin flies;</l>
     <l n="125">As when the Pleiades arise,</l>
     <l n="126">The southern wind afflicts the skies,</l>
     <l n="127">Then, mutt'ring o'er the deep, buffets th' unruly brine,</l>
     <l n="128">'Till clouds and water seem to join.</l>
     <l n="129">Or as a dyke cut by malicious hands,</l>
     <l n="130">O'erflows the fertile Netherlands;</l>
     <l n="131">Thro' the wide yawn, th' impetuous sea,</l>
     <l n="132">Lavish of his new liberty,</l>
     <l n="133">Bestrides the vale, and, with tumultuous noise,</l>
     <l n="134">Bellows along the delug'd plain</l>
     <l n="135">Pernicious to the rip'ning grain;</l>
     <l n="136">Far as th' horizon he destroys:</l>
     <l n="137">The weeping shepherd from an hill bewails the wat'ry reign.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="138">So rapid flows the unimprison'd stream!</l>
     <l n="139">So strong the force of MINDELHEIM!</l>
     <l n="140">In vain the woods of Audenard</l>
     <l n="141">Would shield the Gaul, a fenceless guard.</l>
     <l n="142">As soon may whirl-winds be with-held,</l>
     <l n="143">As MARLB'ROUGH'S footsteps o'er the foaming Scheld.</l>
     <l n="144">In vain the torrent would oppose,</l>
     <l n="145">In vain arm'd banks, and hosts of foes:</l>
     <l n="146">The foes with coward-haste retire,</l>
     <l n="147">Fly faster than the river flows,</l>
     <l n="148">And swifter than our fire.</l>
     <l n="149">Vendosme from far upbraids their shame,</l>
     <l n="150">And pleads his royal master's fame.</l>
     <l n="151">"By Cond√®'s mighty ghost," he cries,</l>
     <l n="152">"By Turenne, Luxemburgh, and all</l>
     <l n="153">"Those noble souls, who fell a sacrifice</l>
     <l n="154">"At Lens, at Fleurus, and at Landen fight,</l>
     <l n="155">"Stop, I conjure, your ignominious flight."</l>
     <l n="156">But Fear is deaf to Honour's call.</l>
     <l n="157">Each frowning threat and soothing pray'r</l>
     <l n="158">Is lost in the regardless air:</l>
     <l n="159">As well he may</l>
     <l n="160">The billows of the ocean stay;</l>
     <l n="161">While CHURCHILL like a driving wind,</l>
     <l n="162">Or high spring-tide, pursues behind,</l>
     <l n="163">And with redoubled speed urges their forward way.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="164">Nor less, EUGENIUS, thy important care,</l>
     <l n="165">Thou second thunder-bolt of war!</l>
     <l n="166">Partner in danger and in fame,</l>
     <l n="167">The wind, with MARLBOROUGH'S, shall bear</l>
     <l n="168">To distant colonies thy conqu'ring name.</l>
     <l n="169">Nor shall my Muse forget to sing</l>
     <l n="170">From harmony what blessings spring:</l>
     <l n="171">To tell how Death did enviously repine,</l>
     <l n="172">To see a friendship so divine;</l>
     <l n="173">When in a ball's destroying form she past,</l>
     <l n="174">And mark'd thy threaten'd brow at last,</l>
     <l n="175">But durst not touch that sacred brain,</l>
     <l n="176">Where Europe's mightiest counsels reign;</l>
     <l n="177">For strait she bow'd her ghastly head,</l>
     <l n="178">She saw the mark of heav'n, and fled,</l>
     <l n="179">As cruel Brennus once, insulting Gaul,</l>
     <l n="180">When he, at Allia's fatal flood,</l>
     <l n="181">Had fill'd the plains with Roman blood,</l>
     <l n="182">With conscious awe forsook the capitol,</l>
     <l n="183">Where Jove, revenger of profaneness, stood.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="184">But where the good and brave command,</l>
     <l n="185">What capitol, what bulwark can withstand?</l>
     <l n="186">Virtue, approv'd of heav'n, can pass</l>
     <l n="187">Thro' walls, thro' tow'rs, and gates of brass.</l>
     <l n="188">Lisle, like a mistress, had been courted long,</l>
     <l n="189">By all the valiant and the young,</l>
     <l n="190">The fairest progeny of Vauban's art;</l>
     <l n="191">'Till SAVOY'S warlike prince withstood</l>
     <l n="192">Her frowning terrors, and thro' seas of blood</l>
     <l n="193">Tore the bright darling from th' old tyrant's heart.</l>
     <l n="194">Such Buda saw him, when proud Apti fell,</l>
     <l n="195">Unhappy, valiant infidel!</l>
     <l n="196">Who, vanquish'd by superior strength,</l>
     <l n="197">Surrender'd up his haughty breath,</l>
     <l n="198">Upon the breach measuring his manly length,</l>
     <l n="199">And shun'd the bow-string by a nobler death.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="200">Such Harscam's field beheld him in his bloom,</l>
     <l n="201">When Victory bespoke him for her own.</l>
     <l n="202">Her favourite, immortal son,</l>
     <l n="203">And told of better years revolving on the loom:</l>
     <l n="204">How he should make the Turkish crescent wane,</l>
     <l n="205">And choak Tibiscus with the slain;</l>
     <l n="206">While Viziers lay beneath the lofty pile</l>
     <l n="207">Of slaughter'd Bassaus, who o'er Bassaus roll'd;</l>
     <l n="208">And all his num'rous acts she told,</l>
     <l n="209">From Latian Carpi down to Flandrian Lisle.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="210">Honour, with open arms, receives at last</l>
     <l n="211">The heroes who thro' Virtue's temple past;</l>
     <l n="212">And show'rs down laurels from above,</l>
     <l n="213">On those whom heav'n and ANNA love.</l>
     <l n="214">And some, not sparingly, she throws</l>
     <l n="215">For the young eagles, who could try</l>
     <l n="216">The faith and judgment of the sky,</l>
     <l n="217">And dare the sun with steady eye;</l>
     <l n="218">For Hanover's and Prussia's brows,</l>
     <l n="219">Eugenes in bloom, and future Marlboroughs:</l>
     <l n="220">To Hanover, to Brunswick's second grace,</l>
     <l n="221">Descendent from a long imperial race,</l>
     <l n="222">The Muse directs her honourable flight,</l>
     <l n="223">And prophesies, from so serene a morn,</l>
     <l n="224">To what clear glories he is born,</l>
     <l n="225">When blazing with a full meridian light,</l>
     <l n="226">He shall the British hemisphere adorn;</l>
     <l n="227">When Mars shall lay his batter'd target down,</l>
     <l n="228">And he, (since Death will never spare</l>
     <l n="229">The good, the pious, and the fair)</l>
     <l n="230">In his ripe harvest of renown,</l>
     <l n="231">Shall after his great father sit,</l>
     <l n="232">(If heav'n so long a life permit)</l>
     <l n="233">And having swell'd the flowing tide</l>
     <l n="234">Of fame, which he in arms shall get,</l>
     <l n="235">The purchase of an honest sweat,</l>
     <l n="236">Shall safe in stormy seas Britannia's vessel guide.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="237">Britannia's vessel, which in ANNA'S reign,</l>
     <l n="238">And prudent pilotry, enjoys</l>
     <l n="239">The tempest which the world destroys,</l>
     <l n="240">And rides triumphant o'er the subject main.</l>
     <l n="241">O may she soon a quiet harbour gain!</l>
     <l n="242">And sure the promis'd hour is come,</l>
     <l n="243">When in soft notes the peaceful lyre</l>
     <l n="244">Shall still the trumpet and the drum,</l>
     <l n="245">Shall play what gods and men desire,</l>
     <l n="246">And strike Bellona's musick dumb:</l>
     <l n="247">When War, by parents curs'd, shall quit the field,</l>
     <l n="248">Unbuckle his bright helmet, and, to rest</l>
     <l n="249">His weary'd limbs, sit on his idle shield,</l>
     <l n="250">With scars of honour plow'd upon his breast.</l>
     <l n="251">But if the Gallic Pharaoh's stubborn heart</l>
     <l n="252">Grows fresh for punishment, and hardens still;</l>
     <l n="253">Prepar'd for th' irrecoverable ill,</l>
     <l n="254">And forc'd th'unwilling skies to act the last ungrateful part:</l>
     <l n="255">Thy forces, ANNA, like a flood, shall whelm</l>
     <l n="256">(If heav'n does scepter'd innocence maintain)</l>
     <l n="257">His famish'd desolated realm;</l>
     <l n="258">And all the sons of Pharamond in vain</l>
     <l n="259">(Who with dishonest envy see</l>
     <l n="260">The sweet forbidden fruits of distant liberty)</l>
     <l n="261">Shall curse their Salic law, and wish a female reign.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="262">A female reign like thine,</l>
     <l n="263">O ANNA, British heroine!</l>
     <l n="264">To thee afflicted empires fly for aid,</l>
     <l n="265">Where'er tyrannick standards are display'd,</l>
     <l n="266">From the wrong'd Iber to the threaten'd Rhine.</l>
     <l n="267">Thee, where the golden-sanded Tagus flows</l>
     <l n="268">Beneath fair Ulyssippo's walls,</l>
     <l n="269">The frighted Lusitanian calls;</l>
     <l n="270">Thee they who drink the Seine, with those</l>
     <l n="271">Who plow Iberian fields, implore,</l>
     <l n="272">To give the lab'ring world repose,</l>
     <l n="273">And universal peace restore:</l>
     <l n="274">Thee, Gallia; mournful to survive the fate</l>
     <l n="275">Of her fall'n grandeur and departed state;</l>
     <l n="276">By sad experience taught to own,</l>
     <l n="277">That virtue is a noble way to rise,</l>
     <l n="278">A surer passage to the skies,</l>
     <l n="279">Than Pelion upon Ossa thrown:</l>
     <l n="280">For they, who impiously presume</l>
     <l n="281">To grasp at heav'n, by JOVE'S eternal doom,</l>
     <l n="282">A prey to thunder shall become;</l>
     <l n="283">Or, sent in Aetna's fiery caves to groan,</l>
     <l n="284">Gain but an higher fall, a mountain for their tomb.</l>
