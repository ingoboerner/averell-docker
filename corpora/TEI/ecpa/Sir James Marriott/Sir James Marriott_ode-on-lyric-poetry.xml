    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">INMATE of smoaking cots, whose rustic shed,</l>
     <l n="2">Within its humble bed,</l>
     <l n="3">Her twittering progeny contains,</l>
     <l n="4">The swallow sweeps the plains,</l>
     <l n="5">Or lightly skims from level lakes the dew.</l>
     <l n="6">The ringdove ever true</l>
     <l n="7">In plaintive accents tells of unrelenting fate,</l>
     <l n="8">Far from the raven's croak, and bird of night,</l>
     <l n="9">That shrieking wings her flight</l>
     <l n="10">When, at his mutter'd rite,</l>
     <l n="11">Hid in the dusky desart vale,</l>
     <l n="12">With starting eye, and visage pale</l>
     <l n="13">The grimly wizard sees the spectres rise unholy;</l>
     <l n="14">But haunts the woods that held her beauteous mate,</l>
     <l n="15">And wooes the Echo soft with murmurs melancholy.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="16">Sublime alone the feather'd monarch flies,</l>
     <l n="17">His nest dark mists upon the mountains shrowd;</l>
     <l n="18">In vain the howling storms arise,</l>
     <l n="19">When borne on outstretch'd plume aloft he springs,</l>
     <l n="20">Dashing with many a stroke the parting cloud,</l>
     <l n="21">Or to the buoyant air commits his wings</l>
     <l n="22">Floating with even sail adown the liquid skies;</l>
     <l n="23">Then darting upward, swift his wings aspire,</l>
     <l n="24">Where thunders keep their gloomy seat,</l>
     <l n="25">And lightnings arm'd with heaven's avenging ire.</l>
     <l n="26">None can the dread artillery meet,</l>
     <l n="27">Or thro' the airy region rove,</l>
     <l n="28">But he who guards the throne of Jove,</l>
     <l n="29">And grasps the flaming bolt of sacred fire.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="30">Know, with young Ambition bold,</l>
     <l n="31">In vain, my Muse, thy dazled eyes explore</l>
     <l n="32">Distant aims, where wont to soar,</l>
     <l n="33">Their burning way the kindling spirits hold.</l>
     <l n="34">Heights too arduous wisely shun;</l>
     <l n="35">Humbler flights thy wings attend;</l>
     <l n="36">For heaven-taught Genius can alone ascend</l>
     <l n="37">Back to her native sky,</l>
     <l n="38">And with directed eagle eye</l>
     <l n="39">Pervade the lofty spheres, and view the blazing sun.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="40">But hark! o'er all the flower-enamell'd ground</l>
     <l n="41">What music breathes around!</l>
     <l n="42">I see, I see the virgin train</l>
     <l n="43">Unlock their streams again,</l>
     <l n="44">Rolling to many a vale their liquid lapse along,</l>
     <l n="45">While at the warbled song</l>
     <l n="46">Which holds entranc'd Attention's wakeful ear,</l>
     <l n="47">Broke are the magic bands of iron sleep.</l>
     <l n="48">Love, wayward child, oft wont to weep,</l>
     <l n="49">In tears his robe to steep</l>
     <l n="50">Forgets; and Care that counts his store,</l>
     <l n="51">Now thinks each mighty business o'er;</l>
     <l n="52">While sits on ruin'd cities, war's wide-wasting glory,</l>
     <l n="53">Ambition, ceasing the proud pile to rear,</l>
     <l n="54">And sighs; unfinish'd leaving half her ample story.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="55">Then once more, sweet enthusiast, happy lyre,</l>
     <l n="56">Thy soothing solace deign awhile to bring.</l>
     <l n="57">I strive to catch the sacred fire,</l>
     <l n="58">And wake thee emulous on Granta's plain,</l>
     <l n="59">Where all the Muses haunt his hallow'd spring,</l>
     <l n="60">And where the Graces shun the sordid train</l>
     <l n="61">Scornful of heaven-born arts which thee and peace inspire:</l>
     <l n="62">On life's sequester'd scenes they silent wait,</l>
     <l n="63">Nor heed the baseless pomp of power,</l>
     <l n="64">Nor shining dreams that crowd at Fortune's gate;</l>
     <l n="65">But smooth th' inevitable hour</l>
     <l n="66">Of pain, which man is doom'd to know,</l>
     <l n="67">And teach the mortal mind to glow</l>
     <l n="68">With pleasures plac'd beyond the shaft of Fate.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="69">But, alas! th' amusive reed</l>
     <l n="70">Ill suits the lyre that asks a master's hand,</l>
     <l n="71">And fond fancies vainly feed</l>
     <l n="72">A breast that life's more active scenes demand.</l>
     <l n="73">Sloth ignoble to disclaim</l>
     <l n="74">'Tis enough: the lyre unstring.</l>
     <l n="75">At other feet the victor palm I fling</l>
     <l n="76">In Granta's glorious shrine;</l>
     <l n="77">Where crown'd with radiance divine</l>
     <l n="78">Her smiles shall nurse the Muse; the Muse shall list her fame.</l>
