    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">INHERITANCE of weak, but proud Mortality,</l>
     <l n="2">Hence, Disease and pining Pain;</l>
     <l n="3">With all your pale and ghastly train,</l>
     <l n="4">Tossings dire, heart-piercing Moans,</l>
     <l n="5">Sighs, and Tears, and hollow Groans,</l>
     <l n="6">The harbingers of Death:</l>
     <l n="7">Whether ye be</l>
     <l n="8">The spawn of bloated Luxury,</l>
     <l n="9">Or of the pestilential breath</l>
     <l n="10">Of Eurus bred: or from the eastern clime:</l>
     <l n="11">Hence! to your ancient seat,</l>
     <l n="12">Where ebbing Nilus leaves his putrid slime,</l>
     <l n="13">To Volga's banks retreat,</l>
     <l n="14">Or to the Caspian, or Bengala's bay;</l>
     <l n="15">From Britain's happy lands</l>
     <l n="16">Haste to Arabian sands,</l>
     <l n="17">While winds sulphureous burn, and urge your way:</l>
     <l n="18">But, Goddess of the dimpled cheek,</l>
     <l n="19">Whom the wanton Cupids seek,</l>
     <l n="20">Come, fair Health, to grace the song,</l>
     <l n="21">Bring the chearful Muse along;</l>
     <l n="22">Bring laughing Youth, who looks behind;</l>
     <l n="23">Love on Fancy's breast reclin'd;</l>
     <l n="24">Wit, no poison'd dart who flings,</l>
     <l n="25">Or but retorts when Envy stings.</l>
     <l n="26">Come with antic Merriment,</l>
     <l n="27">And the placid child Content;</l>
     <l n="28">All with happy steps advance,</l>
     <l n="29">Join the song, and lead the dance.</l>
     <l n="30">Oft, O Goddess! let thy feet</l>
     <l n="31">Visit this my lone retreat;</l>
     <l n="32">Where my oak extends its pride</l>
     <l n="33">Of twisted arms; and fit to ride</l>
     <l n="34">Sublime on Neptune's swelling wave,</l>
     <l n="35">Now the roaring winds doth brave;</l>
     <l n="36">Where the vine's soft tendrils run,</l>
     <l n="37">And swell to meet the southern sun:</l>
     <l n="38">Where Contemplation, wont to stray,</l>
     <l n="39">Winds thro' the wood her easy way,</l>
     <l n="40">Or marks the lake, the field, or sky;</l>
     <l n="41">The silent Angler's stedfast eye;</l>
     <l n="42">The Gunner's aim: or Industry,</l>
     <l n="43">Who, with his loud resounding blow,</l>
     <l n="44">Lays the nodding forest low;</l>
     <l n="45">Or teaches where to wind the stream;</l>
     <l n="46">Or whistles to his labouring team:</l>
     <l n="47">The meads which suck the dews of morn;</l>
     <l n="48">Or uplands crown'd with golden corn,</l>
     <l n="49">Richer than Iberia's mine:</l>
     <l n="50">The bleating flocks; the lowing kine;</l>
     <l n="51">The smoking cots, and pointed spires,</l>
     <l n="52">The setting sun's reflecting fires;</l>
     <l n="53">Woods dark waving in the dale;</l>
     <l n="54">Rays which gleam; and clouds which sail;</l>
     <l n="55">Shades and lights by turns contending;</l>
     <l n="56">Gradual colours softly blending;</l>
     <l n="57">All as Nature's pencil clear</l>
     <l n="58">Marks the variegated year:</l>
     <l n="59">These, O Goddess! these are thine;</l>
     <l n="60">Offspring of immortal line;</l>
     <l n="61">Who with mortals deign'st to dwell,</l>
     <l n="62">In some low and rural cell:</l>
     <l n="63">To haunt the brink of tinkling rills;</l>
     <l n="64">The flowery vales, or sloping hills;</l>
     <l n="65">And when the plowman turns the soil,</l>
     <l n="66">To chear his song, and guide his toil.</l>
     <l n="67">With vest succinct in Dian's train</l>
     <l n="68">Oft art thou seen to brush the plain,</l>
     <l n="69">While thy shrill horns sweet Echo rouse,</l>
     <l n="70">Slumbering on the mountain's brows:</l>
     <l n="71">Oft when Winter clouds the air,</l>
     <l n="72">To the blazing hearth repair</l>
     <l n="73">Thy social feet, where-e'er the bowl</l>
     <l n="74">Of moderate Mirth unlocks the soul,</l>
     <l n="75">When tales of time, and ancient fear</l>
     <l n="76">Suspend the young astonish'd ear:</l>
     <l n="77">Or carrols quaint in long-drawn note</l>
     <l n="78">Swell the rustic's ample throat:</l>
     <l n="79">Or where high lifted steps resound,</l>
     <l n="80">When the peasant thumps the ground</l>
     <l n="81">With aukward heel; and gives a fall</l>
     <l n="82">To mistress of the rural ball:</l>
     <l n="83">Or presses with his iron hand,</l>
     <l n="84">And whirls her thro' the shouting band.</l>
     <l n="85">Nor art thou wont with these to sport</l>
     <l n="86">Alone: but where the Loves resort,</l>
     <l n="87">With all the young and shining train</l>
     <l n="88">Of Cytherea's golden reign,</l>
     <l n="89">More elegant, to lead is thine</l>
     <l n="90">The dance; which waves its easy line;</l>
     <l n="91">Marks the graceful, and the strong;</l>
     <l n="92">Where speech to which no words belong</l>
     <l n="93">Makes love by actions never pain'd,</l>
     <l n="94">All oppos'd, but nought constrain'd:</l>
     <l n="95">Movements mixing, swift, and slow,</l>
     <l n="96">And foot, ear, eye, together go.</l>
     <l n="97">Thus flush'd with all thy native charms,</l>
     <l n="98">My Delia spreads her winning arms,</l>
     <l n="99">Uplisted soft, and seems to tread</l>
     <l n="100">On yielding air, or ocean's bed:</l>
     <l n="101">And, as she grants her modest hand,</l>
     <l n="102">Damon's happy eyes demand,</l>
     <l n="103">While mov'd by her he seems to live,</l>
     <l n="104">The heart, which she half seems to gives</l>
     <l n="105">If these delights, O Goddess! wait</l>
     <l n="106">Ever on thy happy state,</l>
     <l n="107">Best of blessings understood,</l>
     <l n="108">Only source of mortal good;</l>
     <l n="109">Hither, bright Hygeia, fly</l>
     <l n="110">With rosy cheek, and sparkling eye,</l>
     <l n="111">Such as thou dost oft appear</l>
     <l n="112">When thy Heberden is near.</l>
     <l n="113">Rich with Nature's genuine grace,</l>
     <l n="114">Come, Goddess! to my warm embrace,</l>
     <l n="115">Far from all I fear, or hate;</l>
     <l n="116">From splendid life's delusive state,</l>
     <l n="117">Smiles that stab, or that betray:</l>
     <l n="118">Gloom of heart with visage gay;</l>
     <l n="119">Splender canker'd with distress,</l>
     <l n="120">Grandeur mix'd with littleness,</l>
     <l n="121">Words of wind, and hopes of air,</l>
     <l n="122">Clouds which threaten dark despair,</l>
     <l n="123">Craft disloyal to his trust,</l>
     <l n="124">Here High Birth licking low the dust,</l>
     <l n="125">There upstart Meanness set astride</l>
     <l n="126">The world, too narrow for his pride.</l>
     <l n="127">Far from Trade's too busy seat,</l>
     <l n="128">Of Loss and Gain the low deceit,</l>
     <l n="129">Aukward Pomp, and Vanity,</l>
     <l n="130">Who restless drive, and mount the sky,</l>
     <l n="131">Proud of misus'd Liberty;</l>
     <l n="132">While sordid Cunning, Passion blind,</l>
     <l n="133">Ride on the gilded car behind.</l>
     <l n="134">From Law's grimace, and mean chicane,</l>
     <l n="135">Which rivets, when it seems the chain</l>
     <l n="136">To loose; receives the golden shower,</l>
     <l n="137">And offers hecatombs to Power.</l>
     <l n="138">From language low, which vulgars prize,</l>
     <l n="139">Creeping Arts which mean to rise;</l>
     <l n="140">Labyrinths, which ever wind</l>
     <l n="141">In the dark and double mind:</l>
     <l n="142">From Profession's learned scene;</l>
     <l n="143">Cant of words, which little mean:</l>
     <l n="144">Physic, child of Luxury;</l>
     <l n="145">Clok'd in shallow mystery:</l>
     <l n="146">False Religion's forms, which bind</l>
     <l n="147">The body to enslave the mind:</l>
     <l n="148">Disputation's rage and trouble:</l>
     <l n="149">Philosophic system's bubble:</l>
     <l n="150">From War's parade; or Eloquence</l>
     <l n="151">In senates, big with smooth pretence</l>
     <l n="152">Of public good: from Envy mean,</l>
     <l n="153">Who midst the liberal Arts is seen,</l>
     <l n="154">Corrodes the page which Genius drew,</l>
     <l n="155">And turns aside her sullen view,</l>
     <l n="156">Each work of Merit pleas'd to blast,</l>
     <l n="157">Then feeds upon herself at last.</l>
     <l n="158">From these, immortal Goddess! fly,</l>
     <l n="159">And bless thy humble votary.</l>
     <l n="160">Give me Reason's lasting pleasure,</l>
     <l n="161">Ease, but not ignoble leisure:</l>
     <l n="162">Far be wild Ambition's fires,</l>
     <l n="163">Hopeless Love, and fierce Desires.</l>
     <l n="164">I ask not Fortune's glittering charms,</l>
     <l n="165">The pride of courts, the spoils of arms;</l>
     <l n="166">By silver stream, and haunted grove,</l>
     <l n="167">O give my peaceful steps to rove:</l>
     <l n="168">Beneath the shade of pendent hills,</l>
     <l n="169">I'll listen to the falling rills,</l>
     <l n="170">That chafe the pebble, as they stray;</l>
     <l n="171">And haste, like human life, away:</l>
     <l n="172">Then on the flowery carpet green</l>
     <l n="173">I'll sit and trace the rural scene;</l>
     <l n="174">While by the mimic pencil drawn</l>
     <l n="175">The herds shall seem to crop the lawn;</l>
     <l n="176">The piping swain, the distant towers,</l>
     <l n="177">The moss-grown knotted oaks, and bowers,</l>
     <l n="178">As bending to the whispering breeze,</l>
     <l n="179">Some thatch'd cot rising 'mong the trees,</l>
     <l n="180">In rude and artless lines design'd,</l>
     <l n="181">Shall faintly mark the Master's mind.</l>
     <l n="182">Or, if soft verse delight us more,</l>
     <l n="183">O grant of verse the wonderous power</l>
     <l n="184">Strong ideas to inspire;</l>
     <l n="185">Words which paint, and sounds which fire;</l>
     <l n="186">Which calls up shades of heroes bold,</l>
     <l n="187">Whose virtues warm'd the times of old,</l>
     <l n="188">Dressing the historic page</l>
     <l n="189">With Terror, Pity, Love, and Rage;</l>
     <l n="190">Or gives to Truth the tuneful art</l>
     <l n="191">With moral song to mend the heart:</l>
     <l n="192">Flow it easy, soft, and free,</l>
     <l n="193">From ill-conceiv'd obscurity;</l>
     <l n="194">Affectation's crowded plumes,</l>
     <l n="195">All that strains, or that assumes;</l>
     <l n="196">Nature may it e'er pursue,</l>
     <l n="197">Describing, as we feel, the true:</l>
     <l n="198">Her magic glass while Fancy brings,</l>
     <l n="199">Which shews the fleeting form of things,</l>
     <l n="200">Each fair assemblage knows to trace</l>
     <l n="201">All that Nature hath of Grace;</l>
     <l n="202">While Reason lends her sacred aid,</l>
     <l n="203">And in the beautiful display'd,</l>
     <l n="204">Sees with sound philosophy</l>
     <l n="205">The reflected Deity.</l>
     <l n="206">Thus on thro' Manhood, Youth, and Age,</l>
     <l n="207">Nor stain'd with guilt, nor rough with rage,</l>
     <l n="208">In smooth maeanders life shall glide,</l>
     <l n="209">And roll a clear and peaceful tide.</l>
