    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">QUEEN of each sacred sound, sweet child of air,</l>
     <l n="2">Who sitting thron'd upon the vaulted sky,</l>
     <l n="3">Dost catch the notes which undulating fly,</l>
     <l n="4">Oft wafted up to thy exalted sphere,</l>
     <l n="5">On the soft bosom of each rolling cloud,</l>
     <l n="6">Charming thy list'ning ear</l>
     <l n="7">With strains that bid the panting lover die:</l>
     <l n="8">Or laughing mirth, or tender grief inspire,</l>
     <l n="9">Or with full chorus loud</l>
     <l n="10">Which lift our holy hope, or fan the hero's sire:</l>
     <l n="11">Enchanting Harmony, 'tis thine to cheer</l>
     <l n="12">The soul by woe which sinks opprest,</l>
     <l n="13">From sorrow's eye to wipe the tear,</l>
     <l n="14">And on the bleeding wound to pour the balmy rest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="15">'Twas when the winds were roaring loud,</l>
     <l n="16">And Ocean swell'd his billows high,</l>
     <l n="17">By savage hands condemn'd to die,</l>
     <l n="18">Rais'd on the stem the trembling Lesbian stood;</l>
     <l n="19">All pale he heard the tempest blow,</l>
     <l n="20">As on the watry grave below</l>
     <l n="21">He fix'd his weeping eye.</l>
     <l n="22">Ah! hateful lust of impious gold,</l>
     <l n="23">What can thy mighty rage with-hold,</l>
     <l n="24">Deaf to the melting powers of Harmony!</l>
     <l n="25">But ere the bard unpitied dies,</l>
     <l n="26">Again his soothing art he tries,</l>
     <l n="27">Again he sweeps the strings,</l>
     <l n="28">Slowly sad the notes arise,</l>
     <l n="29">While thus in plaintive sounds the sweet musician sings.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="30">From beneath the coral cave</l>
     <l n="31">Circled with the silver wave,</l>
     <l n="32">Where with wreaths of emerald crown'd</l>
     <l n="33">Ye lead the festive dance around,</l>
     <l n="34">Daughters of Venus, hear, and save.</l>
     <l n="35">Ye Tritons, hear, whose blast can swell</l>
     <l n="36">With mighty sounds the twisted shell;</l>
     <l n="37">And you, ye sister Syrens, hear,</l>
     <l n="38">Ever beauteous, ever sweet,</l>
     <l n="39">Who lull the list'ning pilot's ear</l>
     <l n="40">With magic song, and softly breath'd deceit.</l>
     <l n="41">By all the Gods who subject roll</l>
     <l n="42">From gushing urns their tribute to the main,</l>
     <l n="43">By him who bids the winds to roar,</l>
     <l n="44">By him whose trident shakes the shore,</l>
     <l n="45">If e'er for you I raise the sacred strain</l>
     <l n="46">When pious mariners your power adore,</l>
     <l n="47">Daughters of Nereus, hear and save.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="48">He sung, and from the coral cave,</l>
     <l n="49">Circled with the silver wave,</l>
     <l n="50">With pitying ear</l>
     <l n="51">The Nereids hear.</l>
     <l n="52">Gently the waters flowing,</l>
     <l n="53">The winds now ceas'd their blowing,</l>
     <l n="54">In silence listening to his tuneful lay.</l>
     <l n="55">Around the bark's sea-beaten side,</l>
     <l n="56">The sacred dolphin play'd,</l>
     <l n="57">And sportive dash'd the briny tide:</l>
     <l n="58">The joyous omen soon the bard survey'd,</l>
     <l n="59">Nor fear'd with bolder leap to try the watry way.</l>
     <l n="60">On his scaly back now riding,</l>
     <l n="61">O'er the curling billow gliding,</l>
     <l n="62">Again with bold triumphant hand</l>
     <l n="63">He bade the notes aspire,</l>
     <l n="64">Again to joy attun'd the lyre,</l>
     <l n="65">Forgot each danger past, and reach'd secure the land.</l>
