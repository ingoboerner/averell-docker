    <lg n="1" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">WHILE you, my dear girls, in your paradise stray,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Diverting with innocent freedom the day,</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I wander alone in a barbarous land,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Half bak'd by the sun, half blind by the sand.</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then your wood too and grotto so swim in my sight,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">They give me no respite by day nor by night;</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">No sooner asleep but I'm dreaming of you;</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I am just wak'd from one, — wou'd to God it were true.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Methought I was now a fine gentleman grown,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And had got, Lord knows how, an estate of my own.</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Good-bye to plain Tom, I was rais'd a peg higher;</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Some call'd me his worship, and others the squire.</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Twas a place, I remember, exactly like Easton,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on.</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">There I built a fine house with great cost and great care,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">(Your la'ships have form'd many such in the air)</l>
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Not of stucco, nor brick, but as good Portland stone</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">As Kent wou'd desire to be working upon.</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The apartments not small, nor monstrously great,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But chiefly for use, and a little for state;</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">So begilt, and becarv'd, and with ornaments grac'd,</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That ev'ry one said, I'd an excellent taste.</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Here I liv'd like a king, never hoarded my pelf,</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Kept a coach for my sisters, a nag for myself,</l>
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With something that's good when our Highclear friends come,</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And, spite of 'squire Herbert, a fire in each room.</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A canal made for profit as well as for pleasure,</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That's about, let me see, two acres in measure;</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Both the eye to delight, and the table to crown</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With a jack, or a perch, when my uncles come down.</l>
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">An exceeding great wood, that's been set a great while,</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In length near a league, and in breadth near a mile.</l>
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">There ev'ry dear girl her bright genius displays,</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In a thousand fine whimsies a thousand fine ways.</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">O how charming the walks to my fancy appear!</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What a number of temples and grottos are here!</l>
     <l n="37" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">My soul was transported to such an extreme,</l>
     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That I leap'd up in raptures, — when lo! 'twas a dream;</l>
     <l n="39" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then vexing I chid the impertinent day</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For driving so sweet a delusion away.</l>
     <l n="41" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Thus spectres arise, as by nurse-maids we're told,</l>
     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And hie to the place where they buried their gold:</l>
     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">There hov'ring around until morning remain;</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then sadly return to their torments again.</l>
