     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He tun'd up his lyre, as old histories shew,</l>

     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All hell was astonish'd a person so wise</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+" line_length="9">Shou'd rashly endanger his life,</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And venture so far, — but how vast their surprise!</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+" line_length="9">When they heard that he came for his wife.</l>

     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+" line_length="9">— So he gave him his wife back again.</l>

     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He took her again in reward of his art;</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+" line_length="9">Such merit had music in hell!</l>
