     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Lord is my shepherd, my guardian and guide,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For the wants of his creatures the Lord doth provide;</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">E'er since I was born it is he that hath crown'd</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The life that he gave me with blessings around.</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">While yet on the breast a poor infant I hung,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Ere time had unloosen'd the strings of my tongue,</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He gave me the help which I could not then ask,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And now, oh my tongue, let his praise be thy task!</l>

    <lg n="2" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Thro' my tenderest years, with as tender a care,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">My soul like a lamb in his bosom he bare;</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To the brook he would lead me whene'er I had need,</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And point out the pasture where best I might feed;</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">No harm would approach me, for he was my shield</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">From the birds of the air and the beast of the field;</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The wolf to devour me would often times prowl,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But the Lord was my shepherd, and guarded my soul.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">How oft in my youth have I wandered astray,</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And still he hath set me again on the way;</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">When lost in dark error no path I could meet,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His word like a lanthorn hath guided my feet;</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What wond'rous escapes to his kindness I owe,</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">When rash and unthinking I sought my own woe;</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">My soul had long since been gone down to the deep,</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">If the Lord had not watched when I was asleep.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Whene'er at a distance he sees me afraid,</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">O'er the hills and high mountains he comes to my aid,</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then leads me back gently, and bids me abide</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In the midst of his flock, and feed close by his side;</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">How happy if there I could ever remain</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All the days of my life, and not wander again;</l>
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Yea, blest are the people, and happy thrice told,</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who obey the Lord's voice and abide in his fold.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The fold it is full, and the pasture is green,</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All is friendship and love, and no enemy seen;</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">There the Lord dwells amongst us upon his own hill,</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And the mountains all round with his presence doth fill,</l>
     <l n="37" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Himself in the midst with a provident eye,</l>
     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Regarding our wants and procuring supply;</l>
     <l n="39" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He prepareth all things for our safety and food,</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">We gather his gifts, and are filled with good.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="41" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">When he leads forth the flock we all gladly obey</l>
     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For the Lord is himself both our leader and way,</l>
     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The hills smoke with incense where e'er he hath trod,</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And a sacred perfume shews the footsteps of God,</l>
     <l n="45" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Whilst blest with his presence the valleys beneath</l>
     <l n="46" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A sweet smelling savour do constantly breathe;</l>
     <l n="47" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He reneweth the face of each living thing,</l>
     <l n="48" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And the glad Earth enjoys a perpetual spring.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="49" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Or if a far different scene he prepare,</l>
     <l n="50" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And we march thro' the wilderness barren and bare,</l>
     <l n="51" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By his wonderful work's we see plainly enough</l>
     <l n="52" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof;</l>
     <l n="53" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">When hungry and thirsty we're ready to faint,</l>
     <l n="54" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He seeth our need and prevents our complaint;</l>
     <l n="55" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The rain at his word brings us bread from the sky,</l>
     <l n="56" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And rocks become rivers when nature is dry.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="57" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">From the fruitfullest hill to the barrenest rock</l>
     <l n="58" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The Lord hath made all for the sake of his flock,</l>
     <l n="59" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And the flock in return the Lord always confess,</l>
     <l n="60" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Their joy in abundance, their hope in distress;</l>
     <l n="61" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He beholds in our welfare his glory display'd,</l>
     <l n="62" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And we deem ourselves happy when he is obey'd;</l>
     <l n="63" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With a cheerful regard we attend to his ways,</l>
     <l n="64" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Our attention is prayer, and our cheerfulness praise.</l>
