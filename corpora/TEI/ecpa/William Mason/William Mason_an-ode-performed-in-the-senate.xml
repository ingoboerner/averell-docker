    <lg n="1" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="1">HERE all thy active fires diffuse,</l>
     <l n="2">Thou genuine British Muse;</l>
     <l n="3">Hither descend from yonder orient sky,</l>
     <l n="4">Cloth'd in thy heav'n-wove robe of harmony.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="5">Come, imperial queen of song;</l>
     <l n="6">Come with all that free-born grace,</l>
     <l n="7">Which lifts thee from the servile throng,</l>
     <l n="8">Who meanly mimic thy majestic pace;</l>
     <l n="9">That glance of dignity divine,</l>
     <l n="10">Which speaks thee of celestial line;</l>
     <l n="11">Proclaims thee inmate of the sky,</l>
     <l n="12">Daughter of Jove and Liberty.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="nine-line">
     <l n="13">The elevated soul, who feels</l>
     <l n="14">Thy aweful impulse, walks the fragrant ways</l>
     <l n="15">Of honest unpolluted praise:</l>
     <l n="16">He with impartial justice deals</l>
     <l n="17">The blooming chaplets of immortal lays:</l>
     <l n="18">He flies above ambition's low career;</l>
     <l n="19">And nobly thron'd in Truth's meridian sphere,</l>
     <l n="20">Thence, with a bold and heav'n-directed aim,</l>
     <l n="21">Full on fair Virtue's shrine he pours the rays of fame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="22">Goddess! thy piercing eye explores</l>
     <l n="23">The radiant range of Beauty's stores,</l>
     <l n="24">The steep ascent of pine-clad hills,</l>
     <l n="25">The silver slope of falling rills,</l>
     <l n="26">Catches each lively-colour'd grace,</l>
     <l n="27">The crimson of the wood-nymph's face,</l>
     <l n="28">The verdure of the velvet lawn,</l>
     <l n="29">The purple in the eastern dawn,</l>
     <l n="30">Or all those tints, which rang'd in vivid glow</l>
     <l n="31">Mark the bold sweep of the celestial bow.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="32">But chief she lifts her tuneful transports high,</l>
     <l n="33">When to her intellectual eye</l>
     <l n="34">The mental beauties rise in moral dignity:</l>
     <l n="35">The sacred zeal for Freedom's cause,</l>
     <l n="36">That fires the glowing Patriot's breast;</l>
     <l n="37">The honest pride that plumes the Hero's crest,</l>
     <l n="38">When for his country's aid the steel he draws;</l>
     <l n="39">Or that, the calm, yet active heat,</l>
     <l n="40">With which mild Genius warms the Sage's heart,</l>
     <l n="41">To lift fair Science to a loftier seat,</l>
     <l n="42">Or stretch to ampler bounds the wide domain of art.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="43">These, the best blossoms of the virtuous mind,</l>
     <l n="44">She culls with taste refin'd;</l>
     <l n="45">From their ambrosial bloom</l>
     <l n="46">With bee-like skill she draws the rich perfume,</l>
     <l n="47">And blends the sweets they all convey,</l>
     <l n="48">In the soft balm of her mellifluous lay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="49">Is there a clime, where all these beauties rise</l>
     <l n="50">In one collected radiance to her eyes?</l>
     <l n="51">Is there a plain, whose genial soil enhales</l>
     <l n="52">Glory's invigorating gales,</l>
     <l n="53">Her brightest beams where Emulation spreads,</l>
     <l n="54">Her kindliest dews where Science sheds,</l>
     <l n="55">Where every stream of Genius flows,</l>
     <l n="56">Where ev'ry flower of Virtue glows?</l>
     <l n="57">Thither the Muse exulting flies,</l>
     <l n="58">There she loudly cries â€”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="triplet">
     <l n="59">All hail, all hail,</l>
     <l n="60">Majestic Granta! hail thy aweful name,</l>
     <l n="61">Dear to the Muse, to Liberty, to Fame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="62">You too, illustrious Train, she greets</l>
     <l n="63">Who first in these inspiring seats</l>
     <l n="64">Caught the bright beams of that aetherial fire,</l>
     <l n="65">Which now sublimely prompts you to aspire</l>
     <l n="66">To deeds of noblest note: whether to shield</l>
     <l n="67">Your country's liberties, your country's laws;</l>
     <l n="68">Or in Religion's hallow'd cause</l>
     <l n="69">To hurl the shafts of reason, and to wield</l>
     <l n="70">Those heav'nly-temper'd arms, whose rapid force</l>
     <l n="71">Arrests base Falshood in her impious course,</l>
     <l n="72">And drives rebellious Vice indignant from the field.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="73">And now she tunes her plausive song</l>
     <l n="74">To you her sage domestic throng;</l>
     <l n="75">Who here, at Learning's richest shrine,</l>
     <l n="76">Dispense to each ingenuous youth</l>
     <l n="77">The treasures of immortal Truth,</l>
     <l n="78">And open Wisdom's golden mine.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="79">Each youth inspir'd by your persuasive art,</l>
     <l n="80">Clasps the dear form of virtue to his heart;</l>
     <l n="81">And feels in his transported soul</l>
     <l n="82">Enthusiastic raptures roll,</l>
     <l n="83">Gen'rous as those the sons of Cecrops caught</l>
     <l n="84">In hoar Lycaeum's shades from Plato's fire-clad thought.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="85">O Granta! on thy happy plain</l>
     <l n="86">Still may these Attic glories reign:</l>
     <l n="87">Still mayst thou keep thy wonted state,</l>
     <l n="88">In unaffected grandeur great;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13" stanza_type="nine-line">
     <l n="89">Great as this illustrious hour,</l>
     <l n="90">When He, whom GEORGE'S well-weigh'd choice</l>
     <l n="91">And Albion's general voice</l>
     <l n="92">Have lifted to the fairest heights of pow'r,</l>
     <l n="93">When He appears, and deigns to shine</l>
     <l n="94">The leader of thy learned line;</l>
     <l n="95">And bids the verdure of thy olive bough</l>
     <l n="96">'Mid all his civic chaplets twine,</l>
     <l n="97">And add fresh glories to his honour'd brow.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="98">Haste then, and amply o'er his head</l>
     <l n="99">The graceful foliage spread;</l>
     <l n="100">Mean while the Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame,</l>
     <l n="101">And lift her swelling accents high,</l>
     <l n="102">To tell the world that PELHAM'S name</l>
     <l n="103">Is dear to Learning as to Liberty.</l>
    </lg>
