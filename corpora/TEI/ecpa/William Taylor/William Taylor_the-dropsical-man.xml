     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A JOLLY, brave toper, who cou'd not forbear</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tho' his life was in danger, old port and stale beer,</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Gave the doctors the hearing — but still wou'd drink on,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton.</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The more he took physic the worse still he grew,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And tapping was now the last thing he cou'd do.</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Affairs at this crisis, and doctors come down,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He began to consider — so sent for his son.</l>
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tom, see by what courses I've shorten'd my life,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five;</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">More than probable 'tis, that in twenty-four hours,</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">This manor, this house, and estate will be yours;</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">My early excesses may teach you this truth,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth.</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Says Tom, (who's a lad of a generous spirit,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And not like young rakes who 're in haste to inherit,)</l>
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Sir, don't be dishearten'd; altho' it be true,</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Th' operation is painful, and hazardous too,</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'.</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And then, as for years, you may yet be call'd young,</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Your life after this may be happy and long.</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Don't flatter me, Tom, was the father's reply,</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With a jest in his mouth and a tear in his eye;</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Too well by experience, my vessels, thou know'st,</l>
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">No sooner are tap'd, but they give up the ghost.</l>
