     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">HONEST William, an easy and good-natur'd fellow,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Wou'd a little too oft get a little too mellow.</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Body coachman was he to an eminent brewer —</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">No better e'er sat in a box, to be sure.</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His coach was kept clean, and no mothers or nurses</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Took that care of their babes that he took of his horses.</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He had these — ay and fifty good qualities more,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But the business of  cou'd ne'er be got o'er:</l>
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">So his master effectually mended the matter,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By hiring a man, who drank nothing but water.</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Now, William, says he, you see the plain case;</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Had you drunk as he does, you'd kept a good place.</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Drink water! quoth William — had all men done so,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">You'd never have wanted a coachman, I trow.</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">They're soakers, like me whom you load with reproaches,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That enable you brewers to ride in your coaches.</l>
