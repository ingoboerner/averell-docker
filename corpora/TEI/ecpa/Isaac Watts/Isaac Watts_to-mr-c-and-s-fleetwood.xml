     <l n="1">Young Generous Pair,</l>
     <l n="2">Despise the Joys that Fools pursue;</l>
     <l n="3">Bubbles are light and brittle too,</l>
     <l n="4">Born of the Water and the Air.</l>
     <l n="5">Try'd by a Standard Bold and Just</l>
     <l n="6">Honour and Gold are Paint and Dust;</l>
     <l n="7">How vile the last is, and as vain the first:</l>
     <l n="8">Things that the Crowd calls Great and Brave,</l>
     <l n="9">With me how low their Value's brought!</l>
     <l n="10">Titles, and Names, and Life, and Breath,</l>
     <l n="11">Slaves to the Wind and born for Death;</l>
     <l n="12">The Soul's the only Thing We have</l>
     <l n="13">Worth an Important Thought.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="14">The Soul! 'tis of th' Immortal Kind,</l>
     <l n="15">Not form'd of Fire, or Earth, or Wind,</l>
     <l n="16">Outlives the mouldring Corps, and leaves the Globe behind.</l>
     <l n="17">In Limbs of Clay tho' She appears,</l>
     <l n="18">Drest up in Ears and Eyes,</l>
     <l n="19">The Flesh is but the Souls Disguise,</l>
     <l n="20">There's nothing in her Frame kin to the Rags she Wears.</l>
     <l n="21">From all the Laws of Matter free,</l>
     <l n="22">From all we feel, and all we see</l>
     <l n="23">She stands Eternally distinct, and must for ever Be.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="24">Rise then, my Thoughts, on high,</l>
     <l n="25">Soar beyond all that's made to Dye;</l>
     <l n="26">Lo! on an Awful Throne</l>
     <l n="27">Sits the Creatour and the Judge of Souls,</l>
     <l n="28">Whirling the Planets round the Poles,</l>
     <l n="29">Winds off our Threads of Life, and brings our Pe on.</l>
     <l n="30">Swift the Approach, and Solemn is the Day,</l>
     <l n="31">When this Immortal Mind</l>
     <l n="32">Strip't of the Body's coarse Array</l>
     <l n="33">To Endless Pain, or Endless Joy</l>
     <l n="34">Must be at once consign'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="35">Think of the Sands run down to waste,</l>
     <l n="36">We possess none of all the Past,</l>
     <l n="37">None but the Present is our own;</l>
     <l n="38">Grace is not plac'd within our Power,</l>
     <l n="39">'Tis but one short, one shining Hour,</l>
     <l n="40">Bright and declining as a Setting Sun.</l>
     <l n="41">See the white Minutes wing'd with hast;</l>
     <l n="42">The NOW that flies may be the last,</l>
     <l n="43">Seize the Salvation e're 'tis past,</l>
     <l n="44">Nor mourn the Blessing gone:</l>
     <l n="45">A Thoughts Delay is Ruine here,</l>
     <l n="46">A Closing Eye, a Gasping Breath</l>
     <l n="47">Shuts up the Golden Scene in Death,</l>
     <l n="48">And drowns you in Despair.</l>
