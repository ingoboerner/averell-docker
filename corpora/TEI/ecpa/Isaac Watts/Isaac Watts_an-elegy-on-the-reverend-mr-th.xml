    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">YE Virgin Souls, whose Sweet Complaint</l>
     <l n="2">Could teach  not to flow,</l>
     <l n="3">Could  Ruine so Divinely Paint</l>
     <l n="4">Array'd in Beauty and in Woe;</l>
     <l n="5">Awake, ye Virgin Souls, to mourn,</l>
     <l n="6">And with your Tuneful Sorrows dress a Prophet's Urn.</l>
     <l n="7">O could my Lips, or Flowing Eyes</l>
     <l n="8">But imitate such Charming Grief,</l>
     <l n="9">I'de teach the Seas, and teach the Skies</l>
     <l n="10">Wailings, and Sobs, and Sympathies,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor should the Stones, or Rocks be deaf;</l>
     <l n="12">Rocks shall have Eyes, and Stones have Ears,</l>
     <l n="13">While  Death is Mourn'd in Melody and Tears.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="14">Heaven was impatient of our Crimes,</l>
     <l n="15">And sent his Minister of Death</l>
     <l n="16">To Scourge the bold Rebellion of the Times,</l>
     <l n="17">And to demand our Prophet's Breath;</l>
     <l n="18">He came commission'd for the Fates</l>
     <l n="19">Of Awful  and Charming</l>
     <l n="20">There he essay'd the Vengeance first,</l>
     <l n="21">Then took a dismal Aim and brought great  to Dust.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="22">Great  to Dust! How Doleful is the Sound?</l>
     <l n="23">How vast the Stroke is? And how wide the Wound?</l>
     <l n="24">Yes, 'tis a vast uncommon Death,</l>
     <l n="25">Yes, 'tis a Wound unmeasurably wide;</l>
     <l n="26">No Vulgar Mortal Dy'd</l>
     <l n="27">When he resign'd his Breath.</l>
     <l n="28">The Muse that Mourns a Nations Fall</l>
     <l n="29">Shou'd wait at  Funeral,</l>
     <l n="30">Should mingle Majesty and Groans</l>
     <l n="31">Such as she Sings to sinking Thrones,</l>
     <l n="32">And in deep-sounding Numbers tell</l>
     <l n="33">How  trembled when this Pillar fell.</l>
     <l n="34">grows Weak, and  Poor,</l>
     <l n="35">Nature her self with all her Store</l>
     <l n="36">Can furnish such a Pomp for Death no more.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="37">The Reverend Man let all things mourn;</l>
     <l n="38">Sure he was some Aethereal Mind,</l>
     <l n="39">Fated in Flesh to be confin'd,</l>
     <l n="40">And order'd to be Born.</l>
     <l n="41">His Soul was of th' Angelick frame,</l>
     <l n="42">The same Ingredients, and the Mould the same,</l>
     <l n="43">When the Creator makes a Minister of Flame;</l>
     <l n="44">He was all form'd of Heavenly Things,</l>
     <l n="45">Mortals, believe what my  Sings,</l>
     <l n="46">For she has seen him rise upon his Flamy Wings.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="47">How would he mount, how would he fly,</l>
     <l n="48">Up thro' the Ocean of the Sky</l>
     <l n="49">Tow'rd the Coelestial Coast!</l>
     <l n="50">With what amazing swiftness soar</l>
     <l n="51">Till Earth's dark Ball was seen no more</l>
     <l n="52">And all its Mountains lost.</l>
     <l n="53">Scarce could the Muse pursue him with her Sight,</l>
     <l n="54">But, Angels, you can tell,</l>
     <l n="55">For oft you met his Wondrous Flight,</l>
     <l n="56">And knew the Stranger well;</l>
     <l n="57">Say, how he past the radiant Spheres</l>
     <l n="58">And visited your happy Seats,</l>
     <l n="59">And trac'd the well known Turnings of the Golden Streets,</l>
     <l n="60">And walk'd among the Stars.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="61">Tell how he climb'd the Everlasting Hills</l>
     <l n="62">Surveying all the Realms above,</l>
     <l n="63">Born on a Strong-wing'd Faith, and on the Fiery Wheels</l>
     <l n="64">Of an Immortal Love.</l>
     <l n="65">'Twas there he took a glorious Sight</l>
     <l n="66">Of the Inheritance of Saints in Light,</l>
     <l n="67">And read their Title in their Saviour's Right.</l>
     <l n="68">How oft the humble Scholar came,</l>
     <l n="69">And to your Songs he rais'd his Ears</l>
     <l n="70">To learn the Unutterable Name,</l>
     <l n="71">To view the Eternal Base that bears</l>
     <l n="72">The New Creations Frame.</l>
     <l n="73">The Countenance of God he saw</l>
     <l n="74">Full of Mercy, full of Awe,</l>
     <l n="75">The Glories of his Power, and Glories of his Grace:</l>
     <l n="76">There he beheld the Wondrous Springs</l>
     <l n="77">Of those Eternal Sacred Things</l>
     <l n="78">The Peaceful Gospel and the Fiery Law</l>
     <l n="79">In that Majestic Face.</l>
     <l n="80">That Face that all his Gazing Powers employ</l>
     <l n="81">With most profound Abasement and exalted Joy.</l>
     <l n="82">The Rolls of Fate were half unseal'd,</l>
     <l n="83">He stood adoring by;</l>
     <l n="84">The Volumes open'd to his Eye,</l>
     <l n="85">And sweet Intelligence he held</l>
     <l n="86">With all his shining Kindred of the Sky.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="87">Ye Seraphs that surround the Throne,</l>
     <l n="88">Tell how his Name was thro' the Pallace known,</l>
     <l n="89">How warm his Zeal was, and how like your own:</l>
     <l n="90">Speak it aloud, let half the Nation hear,</l>
     <l n="91">And bold Blasphemers shrink and fear:</l>
     <l n="92">Impudent Tongues, to blast a Prophet's Name!</l>
     <l n="93">The Poison sure was fetch'd from Hell</l>
     <l n="94">Where the old Blasphemers dwell,</l>
     <l n="95">To taint the purest Dust, and blot the whitest Fame.</l>
     <l n="96">Impudent Tongues! You should be darted thro',</l>
     <l n="97">Nail'd to your own Black Mouths, and lie</l>
     <l n="98">Useless and Dead till Slander die,</l>
     <l n="99">Till Slander die with you.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="100">"We saw him, say th' Ethereal Throng,</l>
     <l n="101">" We saw his warm Devotions rise,</l>
     <l n="102">"We heard the fervour of his Cries,</l>
     <l n="103">" And mixt his Praises with our Song:</l>
     <l n="104">"We knew the secret Flights of his retiring Hours,</l>
     <l n="105">" Nightly he wak'd his inward Powers,</l>
     <l n="106">"Young  rose to Wrestle with his God,</l>
     <l n="107">" And with unconquer'd Force scal'd the Coelestial Towers</l>
     <l n="108">"To reach the Blessing down for those that sought his Blood.</l>
     <l n="109">" Oft we beheld the Thunderer's Hand</l>
     <l n="110">"Rais'd high to crush the Factious Foe;</l>
     <l n="111">" As oft we saw the rolling Vengeance stand</l>
     <l n="112">"Doubtful t' obey the dread Command,</l>
     <l n="113">" While his ascending Pray'r witheld the falling Blow.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="114">Draw the past Scenes of thy Delight</l>
     <l n="115">My Muse, and bring the Wondrous Man to Sight.</l>
     <l n="116">Place him surrounded as he stood</l>
     <l n="117">With Pious Crowds, while from his Tongue</l>
     <l n="118">A Stream of Harmony ran soft along,</l>
     <l n="119">And every Ear drank in the flowing Good:</l>
     <l n="120">Softly it ran its Silver Way,</l>
     <l n="121">Till warm Devotion rais'd the Current strong;</l>
     <l n="122">Then fervid Zeal on the sweet Deluge rode,</l>
     <l n="123">Life, Love, and Glory, Grace, and Joy</l>
     <l n="124">Divinely roll'd promiscuous on the Torrent-Flood,</l>
     <l n="125">And bore our Raptur'd Sense away, and Thoughts and Souls to God.</l>
     <l n="126">O might we dwell for ever there!</l>
     <l n="127">No more return to breath this grosser Air,</l>
     <l n="128">This Atmosphere of Sin, Calamity, and Care.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="129">But Heavenly Scenes soon leave the Sight</l>
     <l n="130">While we belong to Clay,</l>
     <l n="131">Passions of Terror and Delight</l>
     <l n="132">Demand alternate Sway.</l>
     <l n="133">Behold the Man whose awful Voice</l>
     <l n="134">Could well proclaim the Fiery Law,</l>
     <l n="135">Kindle the Flames that  saw,</l>
     <l n="136">And swell the Trumpets Warlike noise.</l>
     <l n="137">He stands, the Herald of the Threatning Skies,</l>
     <l n="138">Lo, on his Reverend Brow the Frowns Divinely rise,</l>
     <l n="139">All  Thunder on his Tongue, and Lightning in his Eyes.</l>
     <l n="140">Round the high Roof the Curs√®s flew</l>
     <l n="141">Distinguishing each guilty Head,</l>
     <l n="142">Far from th' unequal War the Atheist fled,</l>
     <l n="143">His Kindled Arrows still pursue,</l>
     <l n="144">His Arrows strike the Atheist thro',</l>
     <l n="145">And fix him down to Dread.</l>
     <l n="146">The Marble Heart groans with an inward Wound:</l>
     <l n="147">Blaspheming Souls of harden'd Steel</l>
     <l n="148">Shriek out amaz'd at the new Pangs they feel,</l>
     <l n="149">And dread the Eccho's of the Sound.</l>
     <l n="150">The Lofty Wretch Arm'd and Array'd</l>
     <l n="151">In gaudy Pride sinks down his Impious Head,</l>
     <l n="152">Plunges in dark Despair, and mingles with the Dead.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="153">Now Muse assume a softer Strain,</l>
     <l n="154">Now sooth the Sinners Raging Smart,</l>
     <l n="155">Borrow of  the wondrous Art</l>
     <l n="156">To calm the Surging Conscience, and asswage the Pain.</l>
     <l n="157">He from a Bleeding God derives</l>
     <l n="158">Life for the Souls that Guilt had slain,</l>
     <l n="159">And strait the dying Rebel lives,</l>
     <l n="160">The Dead arise again.</l>
     <l n="161">The opening Skies almost obey</l>
     <l n="162">His powerful Song, a Heavenly Ray</l>
     <l n="163">Awakes Despair to Light, and sheds a cheerful Day.</l>
     <l n="164">His wondrous Voice rolls back the Spheres,</l>
     <l n="165">Recalls the Scenes of Ancient Years</l>
     <l n="166">To make the Saviour known;</l>
     <l n="167">Sweetly the flying Charmer roves</l>
     <l n="168">Thro' all his Labours and his Loves,</l>
     <l n="169">The Anguish of his Cross, and Triumphs of his Throne.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="170">Hark, he invites our Feet to try</l>
     <l n="171">The steep ascent of</l>
     <l n="172">And sets the fatal Tree before our Eye:</l>
     <l n="173">See here Coelestial Sorrow reigns;</l>
     <l n="174">Rude Nails and ragged Thorns lay by</l>
     <l n="175">Ting'd with the Crimson of Redeeming Veins.</l>
     <l n="176">In wondrous Words he sung the Vital Flood</l>
     <l n="177">Where all our Sins were drown'd,</l>
     <l n="178">Words fit to heal and fit to wound,</l>
     <l n="179">Sharp as the Spear, and Balmy as the Blood.</l>
     <l n="180">In his Discourse Divine</l>
     <l n="181">Afresh the Purple Fountain flow'd,</l>
     <l n="182">Our falling Tears kept Sympathetick Time</l>
     <l n="183">And trickled to the Ground,</l>
     <l n="184">While every Accent gave a doleful Sound,</l>
     <l n="185">Sad as the breaking Heart-strings of th' Expiring God.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="186">Down to the Mansions of the Dead</l>
     <l n="187">With trembling Joy our Souls are lead,</l>
     <l n="188">The Captives of his Tongue;</l>
     <l n="189">There the dear Prince of Light reclines his Head</l>
     <l n="190">Darkness and Shades among.</l>
     <l n="191">With pleasing Horror we survey</l>
     <l n="192">The Caverns of the Tomb,</l>
     <l n="193">Where the Belov'd Redeemer lay</l>
     <l n="194">And shed a sweet Persume.</l>
     <l n="195">Hark, the Old Earthquake roars again</l>
     <l n="196">In  Voice, and breaks the Chain</l>
     <l n="197">Of heavy Death, and tears the Tombs;</l>
     <l n="198">The  he comes, he comes,</l>
     <l n="199">With Throngs of waking Saints, a long triumphing Train.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="200">See the bright Squadrons of the Sky,</l>
     <l n="201">Downward on Wings of Joy and Hast they fly,</l>
     <l n="202">Meet their returning Sovereign and attend him high.</l>
     <l n="203">A shining Carr the Conqueror fills</l>
     <l n="204">Form'd of a Golden Cloud;</l>
     <l n="205">Slowly the Pomp rolls up the Azure Hills,</l>
     <l n="206">Old  foams and yells aloud,</l>
     <l n="207">And gnaws th' Eternal Brass that binds him to the Wheels.</l>
     <l n="208">The opening Gates of Bliss receive their King,</l>
     <l n="209">The Father-God Smiles on his Son,</l>
     <l n="210">Pays him the Honours he has won,</l>
     <l n="211">The lofty Thrones adore, and little Cherubs Sing.</l>
     <l n="212">Behold him on his Native Throne,</l>
     <l n="213">Glory sits fast upon his Head;</l>
     <l n="214">Dress't in new Light and Beamy Robes</l>
     <l n="215">His Hand rolls on the Seasons and the shining Globes,</l>
     <l n="216">And sways the living Worlds and Regions of the Dead.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="217">was his Envoy to this Realm below,</l>
     <l n="218">Vast was the Trust, and great his Skill,</l>
     <l n="219">Bright the Credentials he could show,</l>
     <l n="220">And Thousands own'd the Seal.</l>
     <l n="221">His Hallowed Lips could well impart</l>
     <l n="222">The Grace, the Promise, and Command:</l>
     <l n="223">He knew the Pity of  Heart,</l>
     <l n="224">And Terrors of  Hand.</l>
     <l n="225">How did our Souls start out to hear</l>
     <l n="226">The Embassies of Love he bore,</l>
     <l n="227">While every Ear in Rapture hung</l>
     <l n="228">Upon the Charming Wonders of his Tongue.</l>
     <l n="229">Lifes busie Cares a Sacred Silence bound,</l>
     <l n="230">Attention stood with all her Powers,</l>
     <l n="231">With fixed Eyes and Awe profound,</l>
     <l n="232">Chain'd to the Pleasure of the Sound,</l>
     <l n="233">Nor knew the flying Hours.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16">
     <l n="234">But Oh! my everlasting Grief!</l>
     <l n="235">Heaven has recall'd his Envoy from our Eyes,</l>
     <l n="236">Hence Deluges of Sorrow rise,</l>
     <l n="237">Nor hope th' Impossible Relief.</l>
     <l n="238">Ye Remnants of the Sacred Tribe</l>
     <l n="239">Who feel the Loss, come share the Smart,</l>
     <l n="240">And mix your Groans with mine:</l>
     <l n="241">Where is the Tongue that can describe</l>
     <l n="242">Infinite Things with Equal Art,</l>
     <l n="243">Or Language so Divine?</l>
     <l n="244">Our Passions want the Heavenly Flame,</l>
     <l n="245">Almighty Love Breaths faintly in our Songs,</l>
     <l n="246">And Awful Threatnings languish on our Tongues;</l>
     <l n="247">is a Great, but single Name.</l>
     <l n="248">Amidst the Crowd he stands alone;</l>
     <l n="249">Stands yet, but with his Starry Pinions on,</l>
     <l n="250">Dress't for the Flight and ready to be gone:</l>
     <l n="251">Eternal God, command his Stay,</l>
     <l n="252">Stretch the dear Months of his Delay;</l>
     <l n="253">O we could wish his Age were one Immortal Day!</l>
     <l n="254">But when the Flaming Chariot's come</l>
     <l n="255">And shining Guards t' attend thy Prophet Home,</l>
     <l n="256">Amidst a thousand Weeping Eyes</l>
     <l n="257">Send an  down, a Soul of Equal Size,</l>
     <l n="258">Or burn the Worthless Globe, and take us to the Skies.</l>
