     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">"You have wak'd me too soon, I must slumber again;"</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">As the Door on its Hinges, so he on his Bed,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Turns his Sides and his Shoulders and his heavy Head.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">"A little more Sleep, and a little more Slumber;"</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Thus he wastes half his Days, and his Hours without Number;</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And when he gets up he sits folding his Hands,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Or walks about saunt'ring, or trifling he stands.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I pass'd by his Garden, and saw the wild Brier,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The Thorn and the Thistle grow broader and higher;</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The Cloaths that hang on him are turning to Rags:</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And his Money still wastes, till he starves or he begs.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I made him a Visit still hoping to find</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He had took better Care for improving his Mind:</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He told me his Dreams, talk'd of Eating and Drinking;</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves Thinking.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Said I then to my Heart, "Here's a Lesson for me:"</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That Man's but a Picture of what I might be:</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But Thanks to my Friends for their Care in my Breeding,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who taught me betimes to love Working and Reading.</l>
