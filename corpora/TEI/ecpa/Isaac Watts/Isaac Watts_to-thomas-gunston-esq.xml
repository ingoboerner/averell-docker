    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">THE noisy World complains of me</l>
     <l n="2">That I should shun their Sight, and flee</l>
     <l n="3">Visits, and Crowds and Company.</l>
     <l n="4">the Lark dwells in her Nest</l>
     <l n="5">Until she mount the Skies;</l>
     <l n="6">And in my Closet I could rest</l>
     <l n="7">Till to the Heavens I rise.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="8">Yet they will urge, "This private Life</l>
     <l n="9">" Can never make you Blest,</l>
     <l n="10">"And twenty Doors are still at Strife</l>
     <l n="11">" T' engage you for a Guest?</l>
     <l n="12">Friend, should you see the  or</l>
     <l n="13">Open their Royal Gates, and call,</l>
     <l n="14">And wait for  to come,</l>
     <l n="15">He has no Business there at all</l>
     <l n="16">Who finds so much at Home.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="17">When I within my self retreat,</l>
     <l n="18">I shut my Doors against the Great;</l>
     <l n="19">My busy Eyeballs inward roll,</l>
     <l n="20">And there with large survey I see</l>
     <l n="21">All the wide Theatre of Me,</l>
     <l n="22">And view the various Scenes of my retiring Soul;</l>
     <l n="23">There I walk o're the Mazes I have trod,</l>
     <l n="24">While Hope and Fear are in a doubtful Strife</l>
     <l n="25">Whether this  of Life</l>
     <l n="26">Be acted well to gain the Plaudit of my God.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="27">There's a Day hastning, ('tis an Awful Day)</l>
     <l n="28">When the great Sovereign shall at large review</l>
     <l n="29">All that we speak and all we do,</l>
     <l n="30">The several Parts we act on this wide Stage of Clay:</l>
     <l n="31">These he approves, and those he blames,</l>
     <l n="32">And Crowns perhaps a Porter, and a Prince he Damns</l>
     <l n="33">O if the Judge from his tremendous Seat</l>
     <l n="34">Shall not condemn what I have done,</l>
     <l n="35">I shall be Happy tho' unknown,</l>
     <l n="36">Nor need the gazing Rabble, nor the shouting Street.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="37">I hate the  Friend, that springs</l>
     <l n="38">From Vulgar Breath and empty Sound;</l>
     <l n="39">mounts her upward with a Flatt'ring Gale</l>
     <l n="40">Upon her Airy Wings</l>
     <l n="41">Till  Shoots, and  receives the Wound;</l>
     <l n="42">Then her flagging Pinions fail,</l>
     <l n="43">Down  falls and strikes the Ground</l>
     <l n="44">And breaks her batter'd Limbs.</l>
     <l n="45">Rather let me be quite conceal'd from ;</l>
     <l n="46">How happy I should lye</l>
     <l n="47">In Sweet Obscurity,</l>
     <l n="48">Nor the Loud World pronounce my little Name!</l>
     <l n="49">Here I could live and dye alone;</l>
     <l n="50">Or if Society be due</l>
     <l n="51">To keep our Tast of Pleasure new,</l>
     <l n="52">I'de live and die with you,</l>
     <l n="53">For both our Souls are one.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="54">Here we could sit and pass the pleasing Hour,</l>
     <l n="55">And Pity Kingdoms and their Kings,</l>
     <l n="56">And smile at all their shining Things,</l>
     <l n="57">Their Toys of State, and Images of Power;</l>
     <l n="58">should dwell within our Seat,</l>
     <l n="59">alone could make it sweet,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor is her self secure but in a close Retreat.</l>
     <l n="61">While she withdraws from publick Praise</l>
     <l n="62">perhaps would cease to rail,</l>
     <l n="63">it self may innocently gaze</l>
     <l n="64">At Beauty in a Vail.</l>
     <l n="65">But if she once advance to Light,</l>
     <l n="66">Her Charms are lost in  Sight,</l>
     <l n="67">And  is the Mark of Universal Spight.</l>
