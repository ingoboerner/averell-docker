    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">BROTHERS, forbear to call him Blest</l>
     <l n="2">That only has a large Estate,</l>
     <l n="3">Should all the Treasures of the West</l>
     <l n="4">Meet and Conspire to make him Great.</l>
     <l n="5">Let a broad Stream with Golden Sands</l>
     <l n="6">Thro' all his Meadows roll,</l>
     <l n="7">He's but a Wretch with all his Lands</l>
     <l n="8">That wears a narrow Soul.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">He swells amidst his wealthy Store,</l>
     <l n="10">And proudly poizing what he weighs,</l>
     <l n="11">In his own Scale he fondly lays</l>
     <l n="12">Huge Heaps of Shining Oar,</l>
     <l n="13">He spreads the Balance wide to hold</l>
     <l n="14">His Mannors and his Farms,</l>
     <l n="15">And cheats the Beam with Loads of Gold</l>
     <l n="16">He hugs between his Arms.</l>
     <l n="17">So might the Plough-boy climb a Tree,</l>
     <l n="18">When  mounts his Throne,</l>
     <l n="19">And both stand up and smile to see</l>
     <l n="20">How long their Shadow's grown;</l>
     <l n="21">Alass! how vain their Fancies be,</l>
     <l n="22">To think that Shape their own.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="23">Thus mingled still with Wealth and State</l>
     <l n="24">himself can never know;</l>
     <l n="25">His true Dimensions, and his Weight</l>
     <l n="26">Are far inferiour to their show;</l>
     <l n="27">Were I so tall to reach the Pole,</l>
     <l n="28">Or grasp the Ocean with my Span,</l>
     <l n="29">I must be measur'd by my Soul.</l>
     <l n="30">The Mind's the Standard of the Man.</l>
