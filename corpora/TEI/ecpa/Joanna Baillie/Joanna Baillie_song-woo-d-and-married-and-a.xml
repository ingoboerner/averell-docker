     <l n="2" met="ababcdcdefef">Her hair it is snooded sae sleek,</l>
     <l n="3" met="ababcdcdefef">And faithfu' and kind is her Johnny,</l>
     <l n="4" met="ababcdcdefef">Yet fast fa' the tears on her cheek.</l>
     <l n="5" met="ababcdcdefef">New pearlins are cause of her sorrow,</l>
     <l n="6" met="ababcdcdefef">New pearlins and plenishing too,</l>
     <l n="7" met="ababcdcdefef">The bride that has a' to borrow,</l>
     <l n="8" met="ababcdcdefef">Has e'en right mickle ado.</l>
     <l n="9" met="ababcdcdefef">Woo'd and married and a'!</l>
     <l n="10" met="ababcdcdefef">Woo'd and married and a'!</l>

    <lg n="2">
     <l n="13" met="ababcdcdefef">Her mither then hastily spak,</l>
     <l n="14" met="ababcdcdefef">"The lassie is glakit wi' pride;</l>
     <l n="15" met="ababcdcdefef">In my pouch I had never a plack</l>
     <l n="16" met="ababcdcdefef">On the day when I was a bride.</l>
     <l n="17" met="ababcdcdefef">E'en tak' to your wheel, and be clever,</l>
     <l n="18" met="ababcdcdefef">And draw out your thread in the sun;</l>
     <l n="19" met="ababcdcdefef">The gear that is gifted, it never</l>
     <l n="20" met="ababcdcdefef">Will last like the gear that is won.</l>

     <l n="25" met="ababcdcdefef">"Toot, toot!" quo' her grey-headed faither,</l>
     <l n="26" met="ababcdcdefef">"She's less o' a bride than a bairn,</l>
     <l n="27" met="ababcdcdefef">She's ta'en like a cout frae the heather,</l>
     <l n="28" met="ababcdcdefef">Wi' sense and discretion to learn.</l>
     <l n="29" met="ababcdcdefef">Half husband, I trow, and half daddy,</l>
     <l n="30" met="ababcdcdefef">As humour inconstantly leans,</l>
     <l n="31" met="ababcdcdefef">The chiel maun be patient and steady,</l>
     <l n="32" met="ababcdcdefef">That yokes wi' a mate in her teens.</l>
     <l n="33" met="ababcdcdefef">A kerchief sae douce and sae neat,</l>
     <l n="34" met="ababcdcdefef">O'er her locks that the winds used to blaw!</l>
     <l n="35" met="ababcdcdefef">I'm baith like to laugh and to greet,</l>
     <l n="36" met="ababcdcdefef">When I think o' her married at a'!"</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="37" met="ababcdcdefef">Then out spak' the wily bridegroom,</l>
     <l n="38" met="ababcdcdefef">Weel waled were his wordies, I ween,</l>
     <l n="39" met="ababcdcdefef">"I'm rich, though my coffer be toom,</l>
     <l n="40" met="ababcdcdefef">Wi' the blinks o' your bonny blue een.</l>
     <l n="41" met="ababcdcdefef">I'm prouder o' thee by my side,</l>
     <l n="42" met="ababcdcdefef">Though thy ruffles or ribbons be few,</l>
     <l n="43" met="ababcdcdefef">Than Kate o' the Croft were my bride,</l>
     <l n="44" met="ababcdcdefef">Wi' purfles and pearlins enow.</l>
     <l n="45" met="ababcdcdefef">Dear, and dearest of ony!</l>
     <l n="46" met="ababcdcdefef">Ye're woo'd and buikit and a'!</l>
     <l n="47" met="ababcdcdefef">And do ye think scorn o' your Johnny,</l>
     <l n="48" met="ababcdcdefef">And grieve to be married at a'?"</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="49" met="ababcdcdefef">She turned, and she blushed, and she smiled,</l>
     <l n="50" met="ababcdcdefef">And she looket sae bashfully down;</l>
     <l n="51" met="ababcdcdefef">The pride o' her heart was beguiled,</l>
     <l n="52" met="ababcdcdefef">And she played wi' the sleeves o' her gown;</l>
     <l n="53" met="ababcdcdefef">She twirled the tag o' her lace,</l>
     <l n="54" met="ababcdcdefef">And she nippet her boddice sae blue,</l>
     <l n="55" met="ababcdcdefef">Sine blinket sae sweet in his face,</l>
     <l n="56" met="ababcdcdefef">And aff like a maukin she flew.</l>
     <l n="57" met="ababcdcdefef">Woo'd and married and a'!</l>
     <l n="58" met="ababcdcdefef">Wi' Johnny to roose her and a'!</l>
     <l n="59" met="ababcdcdefef">She thinks hersel very weel aff,</l>
     <l n="60" met="ababcdcdefef">To be woo'd and married at a'.</l>
