    <lg n="1" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="1">was on a morn, when we were thrang,</l>
     <l n="2">The kirn it crooned, the cheese was making,</l>
     <l n="3">And bannocks on the girdle baking,</l>
     <l n="4">When ane at the door chapp't loud and lang.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="5">Yet the auld gudewife and her mays sae tight,</l>
     <l n="6">Of a' this bald din took sma' notice I ween;</l>
     <l n="7">For a chap at the door in braid day-light,</l>
     <l n="8">Is no like a chap that's heard at e'en.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="9">But the docksy auld laird of the Warlock glen,</l>
     <l n="10">Wha waited without, half blate, half cheery,</l>
     <l n="11">And lang'd for a sight o' his winsome deary,</l>
     <l n="12">Raised up the latch, and cam' crousely ben.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="13">His coat it was new, and his o'erlay was white,</l>
     <l n="14">His mittens and hose were cozy and bean;</l>
     <l n="15">But a wooer that comes in braid day-light,</l>
     <l n="16">Is no like a wooer that comes at e'en.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="17">He greeted the carline and lasses sae braw,</l>
     <l n="18">And his bare liart pow, sae smoothly he straikit,</l>
     <l n="19">And he looket about, like a body half glaikit,</l>
     <l n="20">On bonny sweet Nanny the youngest of a'.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="21">"Ha laird!" quo' the carline, "and look ye that way?</l>
     <l n="22">Fy, let na' sic fancies bewilder ye clean:</l>
     <l n="23">An elderlin man, in the noon o' the day,</l>
     <l n="24">Should be wiser than youngsters that come at e'en. "</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="25">"Na, na," quo' the pawky auld wife, "I trow,</l>
     <l n="26">You'll no' fash your head wi' a youthfu' gilly,</l>
     <l n="27">As wild and as skeigh as a muirland filly;</l>
     <l n="28">Black Madge is far better and fitter for you. "</l>

    <lg n="8" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="29">He hem'd and he haw'd, and he drew in his mouth,</l>
     <l n="30">And he squeezed the blue bannet his twa hands between,</l>
     <l n="31">For a wooer that comes when the sun's i' the south,</l>
     <l n="32">Is mair landward than wooers that come at e'en.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="33">"Black Madge is sae carefu' " — "What's that to me?"</l>
     <l n="34">"She's sober and ident, has sense in her noddle;</l>
     <l n="35">She's douce and respeckit" — "I care na' a bodle,</l>
     <l n="36">Love winna be guided, and fancy's free."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="37">Madge tossed back her head wi' a saucy slight,</l>
     <l n="38">And Nanny, loud laughing, ran out to the green;</l>
     <l n="39">For a wooer that comes when the sun shines bright,</l>
     <l n="40">Is no like an wooer that comes at e'en.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="41">Then awa flung the Laird, and loud muttered he,</l>
     <l n="42">"A' the daughters of Eve, between Orkney and Tweed o!</l>
     <l n="43">Black or fair, young or auld, dame or damsel or widow,</l>
     <l n="44">May gang in their pride to the de'il for me!</l>

     <l n="45">But the auld gudewife and her mays sae tight</l>
     <l n="46">Cared little for a' his stour banning, I ween;</l>
     <l n="47">For a wooer that comes in braid day light,</l>
