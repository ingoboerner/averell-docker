    <lg n="1" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="1">fires blazed bright till deep midnight,</l>
     <l n="2">And the guests sat in the hall,</l>
     <l n="3">And the Lord of the feast, Lord John of the East,</l>
     <l n="4">Was the merriest of them all.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="5">His dark-grey eye, that wont, so sly,</l>
     <l n="6">Beneath his helm to scowl,</l>
     <l n="7">Flashed keenly bright, like a new-waked sprite,</l>
     <l n="8">As passed the circling bowl.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="9">In laughter light, or jocund lay,</l>
     <l n="10">That voice was heard, whose sound,</l>
     <l n="11">Stern, loud and deep in battle-fray,</l>
     <l n="12">Did foe-men fierce astound;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="13">And stretched so balm, like lady's palm,</l>
     <l n="14">To every jester near,</l>
     <l n="15">That hand which through a prostrate foe</l>
     <l n="16">Oft thrust a ruthless spear.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="17">The gallants sang and the goblets rang,</l>
     <l n="18">And they revelled in careless state,</l>
     <l n="19">Till a thundering sound that shook the ground</l>
     <l n="20">Was heard at the castle gate.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="21">"Who knocks without, so loud and stout? —</l>
     <l n="22">Some wandering knight, I ween,</l>
     <l n="23">Who from afar, like a guiding star,</l>
     <l n="24">Our blazing hall hath seen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="25">"If a stranger it be of high degree,</l>
     <l n="26">(No churl durst make such din,)</l>
     <l n="27">Step forth amain, my pages twain,</l>
     <l n="28">And soothly ask him in.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="29">"Tell him our cheer is the forest deer,</l>
     <l n="30">Our bowl is mantling high,</l>
     <l n="31">And the Lord of the feast is John of the East,</l>
     <l n="32">Who welcomes him courteously."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="33">The pages twain returned again,</l>
     <l n="34">And a wild scared look had they.</l>
     <l n="35">"Why look ye so? — Is it friend or foe?"</l>
     <l n="36">Did the angry Baron say.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="37">"A stately knight without doth wait,</l>
     <l n="38">But further he will not come,</l>
     <l n="39">Till the Baron himself shall stand at the gate</l>
     <l n="40">And ask him to his home."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="41">"By my mother's shroud, he is full proud!</l>
     <l n="42">What earthly man is he?"</l>
     <l n="43">"I know not in truth," quoth the trembling youth,</l>
     <l n="44">"If earthly man it be:</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="45">"In reveller's plight he is bedight,</l>
     <l n="46">With a vest of the crim'sy meet;</l>
     <l n="47">But his mantle behind, that streams on the wind,</l>
     <l n="48">Is a corse's bloody sheet."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="49">"Out! paltry child! thy wits are wild,</l>
     <l n="50">Thy comrade will tell me true: —</l>
     <l n="51">Say plainly then what thou hast seen,</l>
     <l n="52">Or dearly shalt thou rue."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="53">Then spoke the second page with fear,</l>
     <l n="54">And bent him on his knee,</l>
     <l n="55">"Were I on your father's sword to swear,</l>
     <l n="56">The same it appeared to me."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="57">"And is there ne'er of my vassals here,</l>
     <l n="58">Of low or high degree,</l>
     <l n="59">That will unto this stranger go, —</l>
     <l n="60">Will go for the love of me?"</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="61">Then spoke and said fierce Donald the Red,</l>
     <l n="62">(A fearless man was he,)</l>
     <l n="63">"Yes; I will straight to the castle gate,</l>
     <l n="64">Lord John, for the love of thee."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="65">With heart full stout he hied him out,</l>
     <l n="66">While silent all remain:</l>
     <l n="67">Nor moved a tongue those gallants among,</l>
     <l n="68">Till Donald returned again.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="69">"Speak," said his Lord, "by thy hopes of grace!</l>
     <l n="70">What stranger must we hail?"</l>
     <l n="71">But the haggard looks of Donald's face</l>
     <l n="72">Made his faltering words to fail.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="19" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="73">"It is a knight in some foreign guise, —</l>
     <l n="74">His like did I never behold,</l>
     <l n="75">For the stony look of his beamless eyes</l>
     <l n="76">Made my very life-blood cold.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="20" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="77">"I did him greet in fashion meet,</l>
     <l n="78">And bade him your feast to partake;</l>
     <l n="79">But the voice that spoke when he silence broke</l>
     <l n="80">Made the earth beneath me quake.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="21" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="81">"O, such a tone did tongue ne'er own,</l>
     <l n="82">That moved in mortal head;</l>
     <l n="83">It is like a sound from the hollow ground, —</l>
     <l n="84">Like the voice of the coffined dead!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="22" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="85">"I bade him to your social board,</l>
     <l n="86">But in he will not hie,</l>
     <l n="87">Until at the gate this castle's Lord</l>
     <l n="88">Shall entreat him courteously.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="23" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="89">"And a ghastly smile o'er his visage past,</l>
     <l n="90">As he sternly bade me say,</l>
     <l n="91">'It was no vassal who lured your guest</l>
     <l n="92">To that feast of the woody Bay.'"</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="24" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="93">Pale grew the Baron, and faintly said,</l>
     <l n="94">As he heaved his breath with pain,</l>
     <l n="95">"From such a feast, as there was spread,</l>
     <l n="96">Do any return again?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="25" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="97">"I bade my guest to a bloody feast,</l>
     <l n="98">Where the death's-wound was his fare,</l>
     <l n="99">And the Isle's bright Maid who my love betrayed,</l>
     <l n="100">She tore her raven hair.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="26" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="101">"The sea-fowl screams and the watch-tower gleams,</l>
     <l n="102">And the deafening billows roar,</l>
     <l n="103">Where he, unblest, was put to rest</l>
     <l n="104">On a wild and distant shore.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="27" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="105">"Do the hollow grave and the whelming wave</l>
     <l n="106">Give up their dead again?</l>
     <l n="107">Doth the surgy waste waft o'er its breast</l>
     <l n="108">The spirits of the slain?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="28" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="109">But the Baron's limbs shook fast, and poured</l>
     <l n="110">The big drops from his brow,</l>
     <l n="111">As louder still the third time roared</l>
     <l n="112">The thundering gate below.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="29" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="113">"O rouse thee, Baron, for manhood's worth!</l>
     <l n="114">Let good or ill befall,</l>
     <l n="115">Thou must to the stranger knight go forth,</l>
     <l n="116">And ask him to your hall."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="30" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="117">"Rouse thy bold breast," said each eager guest,</l>
     <l n="118">"What boots it shrinking so?</l>
     <l n="119">Be it fiend or sprite, or murdered knight,</l>
     <l n="120">In God's name thou must go.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="31" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="121">"Why should'st thou fear? dost thou not wear</l>
     <l n="122">A gift from the great Glendower, —</l>
     <l n="123">Sandals blest by a holy Priest,</l>
     <l n="124">O'er which nought ill hath power?"</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="32" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="125">All ghastly pale Lord John did quail,</l>
     <l n="126">As he turned him to the door,</l>
     <l n="127">And his sandals blest by a holy Priest</l>
     <l n="128">Sound feebly on the floor.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="33" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="129">Then back to the hall and his merry mates all</l>
     <l n="130">A parting look he sent; —</l>
     <l n="131">"God send thee, amain, safe back again!"</l>
     <l n="132">His head he sadly bent.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="34" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="133">Then listened they on the lengthened way</l>
     <l n="134">To his faint and lessening tread,</l>
     <l n="135">And, when that was past, to the wailing blast,</l>
     <l n="136">That wailed as for the dead.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="35" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="137">But wilder it grew, and stronger it blew,</l>
     <l n="138">And it rose with an elrich sound,</l>
     <l n="139">Till the lofty Keep on its rocky steep</l>
     <l n="140">Fell hurling to the ground.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="36" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="141">Each fearful eye then glanced on high</l>
     <l n="142">To the lofty windowed wall,</l>
     <l n="143">When a fiery trace of the Baron's face</l>
     <l n="144">Through the casements shone on all.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="37" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="145">But the visioned glare passed through the air,</l>
     <l n="146">And the raging tempest ceased,</l>
     <l n="147">And never more, on sea or shore,</l>
     <l n="148">Was seen Lord John of the East.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="38" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="149">The sandals blest by a holy Priest</l>
     <l n="150">Lay unscathed on the swarded green;</l>
     <l n="151">But never again, on land or main,</l>
     <l n="152">Lord John of the East was seen.</l>
