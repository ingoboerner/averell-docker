    <lg n="1" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="1">and fancy were combined</l>
     <l n="2">To stimulate his manly mind;</l>
     <l n="3">Open, generous and acute,</l>
     <l n="4">Steady of purpose, in pursuit</l>
     <l n="5">Ardent and hopeful; all the while</l>
     <l n="6">In child-like ignorance of guile.</l>
     <l n="7">There are who say that envy lurks concealed</l>
     <l n="8">Where genius strives, by slightest traits revealed,</l>
     <l n="9">A truth, if truth it be, by him forgot,</l>
     <l n="10">He turned his eyes away and saw it not.</l>
     <l n="11">Success in others, frank and free,</l>
     <l n="12">He hailed with words of friendly glee.</l>
     <l n="13">Praise given to them he could not feel</l>
     <l n="14">Did aught from his own portion steal;</l>
     <l n="15">And when offence, designed and rude,</l>
     <l n="16">Did on his peaceful path obtrude,</l>
     <l n="17">He soon forgave the paltry pain,</l>
     <l n="18">Nor could resentment in his breast retain.</l>
     <l n="19">His was the charity of right goodwill,</l>
     <l n="20">That loves, confides, believes and thinks no ill.</l>
     <l n="21">He, by his Saviour's noble precepts led,</l>
     <l n="22">Still followed what was right with heart and head.</l>
     <l n="23">Religion did with lofty honour dwell</l>
     <l n="24">Within his bosom's sacred cell.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="25">But said I learning did in him agree</l>
     <l n="26">With fancy, union rare! how could it be?</l>
     <l n="27">His eighteenth year beheld him fondly cheering</l>
     <l n="28">His warlike steed and on its back careering.</l>
     <l n="29">A gay dragoon with spur on heel,</l>
     <l n="30">And brandished blade of flashing steel;</l>
     <l n="31">With wealth at will, the world before him,</l>
     <l n="32">To go where whim or fashion bore him.</l>
     <l n="33">No friendly tutor by his side,</l>
     <l n="34">His academic course to guide.</l>
     <l n="35">No classic honours to invite,</l>
     <l n="36">No emulation to excite.</l>
     <l n="37">But, in default of these, his soul</l>
     <l n="38">With native fire supplied the whole;</l>
     <l n="39">And neither Hall nor College claim</l>
     <l n="40">Honour from him whose honoured name</l>
     <l n="41">Shall henceforth with the highest stand,</l>
     <l n="42">The most efficient scholars of our land.</l>
     <l n="43">To him what meed of thanks the unlearned owe!</l>
     <l n="44">And even the learned, who best his merits know.</l>
     <l n="45">With Homer, Virgil, Wieland, all converse</l>
     <l n="46">Like true compatriots in his pliant verse.</l>
     <l n="47">Pliant but elevated, graceful, bold,</l>
     <l n="48">And worthy of the Bards of old.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="49">Nor will we thanklessly peruse</l>
     <l n="50">The beauties of his native muse,</l>
     <l n="51">Where lofty thoughts and feelings sweet,</l>
     <l n="52">And moral truths commingling meet.</l>
     <l n="53">Where fancy spreads her absent scene,</l>
     <l n="54">The flowery mead, the forest green;</l>
     <l n="55">The plains, the mountain peaks, the fanes sublime,</l>
     <l n="56">The ruins long revered of Italy's fair clime.</l>
     <l n="57">Yea thanks be his, heart-given and kind,</l>
     <l n="58">For all his pen has left behind!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="59">Though bitters in his cup were mixed,</l>
     <l n="60">And in his heart sharp arrows fixed,</l>
     <l n="61">The current of his life ran clear;</l>
     <l n="62">With virtuous love and duteous children blest,</l>
     <l n="63">He journeyed onward to the Christian's rest,</l>
     <l n="64">And happy was his long career.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="65">Social and joyous to the end,</l>
     <l n="66">Around him gathered many a friend,</l>
     <l n="67">Whose minds his dear remembrance hold,</l>
     <l n="68">Though seventy years and more</l>
     <l n="69">His head had silvered o'er,</l>
     <l n="70">As one who ne'er was old.</l>
     <l n="71">Rejoicing in his well-earned fame,</l>
     <l n="72">They oft repeat his honoured name,</l>
     <l n="73">And as their thoughts on all his virtues dwell</l>
     <l n="74">With sorrow, cheered and sweet, bid him a last farewell.</l>
