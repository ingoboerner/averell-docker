     <l n="7">She sups wi' her kimmers on dainties enow,</l>
     <l n="8">Aye bowing and sminning and wiping her mou',</l>
     <l n="9">While I sit aside, and am helpit but sparely,</l>
     <l n="10">O, gin my wife wad feast hooly and fairly</l>

     <l n="19">I' the kirk sic commotion last Sabbath she made,</l>
     <l n="20">Wi' babs o' red roses and breast-knots o'erlaid!</l>
     <l n="21">The Dominie stickit the psalm very nearly:</l>

     <l n="25">She's warring and flyting frae morning till e'en,</l>
     <l n="26">And if ye gainsay her, her een glowr sae keen,</l>
     <l n="27">Then tongue, kneeve, and cudgel she'll lay on ye sairly:</l>

     <l n="37">A word o' guid counsel or grace she'll hear none;</l>
     <l n="38">She bandies the Ellers, and mocks at Mess John,</l>
     <l n="39">While back in his teeth his own text she flings rarely:</l>

     <l n="47">Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly,</l>
     <l n="48">Wasting my breath to cry hooly and fairly!</l>
