    <lg n="1" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="1">presses on my knee this kindly pat,</l>
     <l n="2">And with a merry archness in my face</l>
     <l n="3">Looks up? — a youngling of my own liel race:</l>
     <l n="4">Comest thou to woo my notice, little Matt?</l>
     <l n="5">I think thou dost, and thou shalt have it too,</l>
     <l n="6">For, whatsoe'er thou dost or dost not do,</l>
     <l n="7">Thou hast upon my heart a potent claim, —</l>
     <l n="8">Matthew Baillie is thy name;</l>
     <l n="9">And worn by thee, O never may</l>
     <l n="10">The light transmitted fade away!</l>
     <l n="11">The virtues of thy grandsire's manly breast,</l>
     <l n="12">May they within thy bosom ever rest!</l>
     <l n="13">Far be from thee, dear child, even in thy play,</l>
     <l n="14">A crooked cunning trick or selfish way, —</l>
     <l n="15">All greedy grasping, or of cake or toy!</l>
     <l n="16">Thou must be generous, kind and true, my boy.</l>
     <l n="17">And if, in after days, thou needs must fight</l>
     <l n="18">With angry school-mates, wrestle for the right.</l>
     <l n="19">Whate'er the poor or wealthy do, thou must</l>
     <l n="20">Frank and straight-forward be, faithful and just.</l>
     <l n="21">No seeking favour with fair glozing words!</l>
     <l n="22">No dangling after little patron lords!</l>
     <l n="23">In thee, or man or boy, still let us see</l>
     <l n="24">Traces of him whose name now honours thee.</l>
     <l n="25">He passed, through life with conscience for his guide,</l>
     <l n="26">Nor hesitated, winked, or turned aside.</l>
     <l n="27">He lived in courts, all courtly failings near,</l>
     <l n="28">And knew not feigning, flattery, or fear.</l>
     <l n="29">Be thou a Matthew then from right unswerving,</l>
     <l n="30">And of thy name deserving.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="31">Ah, little man! thy roguish eye</l>
     <l n="32">When those thou lovest are standing by,</l>
     <l n="33">Thy scowling brow and stormy voice,</l>
     <l n="34">When thwarted of thy will or choice,</l>
     <l n="35">Shew thou wilt have no easy play</l>
     <l n="36">Old aunty's precepts to obey.</l>
     <l n="37">Aye! and wee Willie too is near,</l>
     <l n="38">His gladsome, cooing voice, I hear;</l>
     <l n="39">And there he comes in all his charms,</l>
     <l n="40">Set perching in his nurse's arms.</l>
     <l n="41">In his sweet face beam smiles of love</l>
     <l n="42">That o'er cheeks, chin, and forehead move;</l>
     <l n="43">Fat dimpled arms, and shoulders bare,</l>
     <l n="44">The same emotion seem to share;</l>
     <l n="45">Yea, could we see thee all, we should discover</l>
     <l n="46">Thou art  living smile all over.</l>
     <l n="47">Thy small foot too, tinged like the rose,</l>
     <l n="48">With all its spread and stirring toes,</l>
     <l n="49">Its tiny heel and ankle stout,</l>
     <l n="50">From muslin coaties peeping out —</l>
     <l n="51">What part of thee can we behold</l>
     <l n="52">That is not worth a mine of gold?</l>
     <l n="53">Thy open mouth that offers kisses</l>
     <l n="54">So winningly, and seldom misses</l>
     <l n="55">A kind return, full twenty-fold,</l>
     <l n="56">From stern or gentle, young or old;</l>
     <l n="57">Come sweet temptation! near — more near,</l>
     <l n="58">And let me feel its pressure dear!</l>
     <l n="59">Thou little, loving harmless baby,</l>
     <l n="60">Ah! what progressive changes may be;</l>
     <l n="61">When, with thy youth and manhood, future years</l>
     <l n="62">Have dealt, and on thy countenance appears</l>
     <l n="63">The marked expression of thy inward worth,</l>
     <l n="64">By joy, and grief, and love, and generous ire drawn forth!</l>
     <l n="65">Could we even now thy future fortunes know,</l>
     <l n="66">Thy character and thy endowments! — No;</l>
     <l n="67">Why look through onward time to see</l>
     <l n="68">What thou, dear baby, then mayest be?</l>
     <l n="69">I will not from the present part,</l>
     <l n="70">Loving so dearly what thou art.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="71">Matthew and William, brothers twain,</l>
     <l n="72">God's blessing on your heads remain!</l>
     <l n="73">Soft pretty signs and tokens tell</l>
     <l n="74">That now ye love each other well,</l>
     <l n="75">And nature's self and parents kind</l>
     <l n="76">Will round your hearts this blessing bind.</l>
     <l n="77">In sacred words to each dear brother,</l>
     <l n="78">A grand-aunt's say concludes, — "love one another."</l>
