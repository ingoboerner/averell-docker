    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">ADIEU to LEYDEN'S lonely bound,</l>
     <l n="2">The BELGIAN muse's sober seat;</l>
     <l n="3">Where shedding frugal gifts around</l>
     <l n="4">On all the fav'rites at her feet,</l>
     <l n="5">She feeds the body's bulky frame</l>
     <l n="6">For passive, persevering toils;</l>
     <l n="7">And left, for some ambitious aim,</l>
     <l n="8">The daring mind should scorn her homely spoils,</l>
     <l n="9">She breathes maternal foggs to damp its restless flame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="10">Adieu the grave, pacific air,</l>
     <l n="11">Safe from the flitting mountain-breeze;</l>
     <l n="12">The marshy levels lank and bare,</l>
     <l n="13">Sacred from furrows hills or trees:</l>
     <l n="14">Adieu each mantling, fragrant flood,</l>
     <l n="15">Untaughto to murmur or to flow:</l>
     <l n="16">Adieu the music of the mud,</l>
     <l n="17">That sooths at eve the patient lover's woe,</l>
     <l n="18">And wakes to sprightlier thoughts the painful poet's blood.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="19">With looks so frosty, and with steps so tame,</l>
     <l n="20">Ye careful nymphs, ye household things, adieu;</l>
     <l n="21">Not once ye taught me love's or friendship's flame,</l>
     <l n="22">And where is he that ever taught it you?</l>
     <l n="23">And ye, the slow-ey'd fathers of the land,</l>
     <l n="24">With whom dominion lurks from hand to hand,</l>
     <l n="25">Unown'd, undignified by public choice,</l>
     <l n="26">I go where freedom in the streets is known,</l>
     <l n="27">And tells a monarch on his throne,</l>
     <l n="28">Tells him he reigns, he lives but by her voice.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="29">O native ALBION, when to thee</l>
     <l n="30">Shall I return to part no more?</l>
     <l n="31">Far from this pale, discolour'd sea,</l>
     <l n="32">That sleeps upon the reedy shore,</l>
     <l n="33">When shall I plow thy azure tides,</l>
     <l n="34">And, as thy fleece-white hills aspire,</l>
     <l n="35">Bless the fair shade that on their sides</l>
     <l n="36">Imbow'rs the village and the sacred spire,</l>
     <l n="37">While the green hedge, below, the golden slope divides?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="38">Ye nymphs that guard the pathless grove,</l>
     <l n="39">Ye blue-ey'd sisters of the streams,</l>
     <l n="40">With whom I wont at morn to rove,</l>
     <l n="41">With whom at noon I talk'd in dreams;</l>
     <l n="42">O take me to your haunts again,</l>
     <l n="43">The rocky spring, the greenwood glade;</l>
     <l n="44">To prompt my slumbers in the murm'ring shade,</l>
     <l n="45">And sooth my vacant ear with many an airy strain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="46">And thou, my faithful harp, no longer mourn</l>
     <l n="47">Thy drooping master's unpropitious hand;</l>
     <l n="48">Now brighter skies and fresher gales return,</l>
     <l n="49">Now fairer maids thy melody demand.</l>
     <l n="50">Daughters of ALBION, guard your votive lyre!</l>
     <l n="51">O blooming god of Thespia's laurell'd quire,</l>
     <l n="52">Why sounds not mine harmonious as thy own,</l>
     <l n="53">When all the virgin-deities above</l>
     <l n="54">With Venus and with Juno move</l>
     <l n="55">In concert round thy list'ming father's throne?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="56">Thee too, protectress of my lays,</l>
     <l n="57">Elate with whose majestic call</l>
     <l n="58">Above the soft Italian's praise,</l>
     <l n="59">Above the slavish wreaths of Gaul,</l>
     <l n="60">I dare from impious thrones reclaim,</l>
     <l n="61">And wanton sloth's luxurious charms,</l>
     <l n="62">The honours of a poet's name</l>
     <l n="63">To ASHLEY'S wisdom, or to HAMDEN'S arms.</l>
     <l n="64">Thee, freedom, I rejoin, and bless thy genuine flame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="65">Great citizen of Albion! Thee</l>
     <l n="66">Heroic Valour still attends,</l>
     <l n="67">And useful Science pleas'd to see</l>
     <l n="68">How Art her studious toil extends.</l>
     <l n="69">While Truth, diffusing from on high</l>
     <l n="70">A lustre unconfin'd as day,</l>
     <l n="71">Fills and commands the public eye,</l>
     <l n="72">Till pierc'd and sinking by her pow'ful ray,</l>
     <l n="73">Tame Sloth and monkish Awe, like nightly Dae, fly.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="74">Hence all the land the Patriot's ardour shares;</l>
     <l n="75">Hence dread Religion smiles with social joy;</l>
     <l n="76">Hence the free bosom's softest, loveliest cares,</l>
     <l n="77">Each graceful scene of private life imploy.</l>
     <l n="78">O fair BRITANNIA, hail! â€” With partial love</l>
     <l n="79">The tribes of men their native seats approve,</l>
     <l n="80">Unjust and hostile to a foreign fame;</l>
     <l n="81">But when from gen'rous minds and manly laws</l>
     <l n="82">A nation holds her prime applause,</l>
     <l n="83">There public zeal defies the test of blame.</l>
