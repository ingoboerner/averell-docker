     <l n="1" line_length="8">whom the Town admires,</l>
     <l n="2" line_length="8">Whose Wit and Beauty share our Praise,</l>
     <l n="3" line_length="8">This fair  who inspires</l>
     <l n="4" line_length="8">A thousand Joys a thousand ways,</l>
     <l n="5" line_length="8">She, who cou'd with a Glance convey</l>
     <l n="6" line_length="8">Favours, that had my Hopes outdone,</l>
     <l n="7" line_length="8">Has lent me Money on that Day,</l>
     <l n="8" line_length="8">Which our Acquaintance first begun.</l>
     <l n="9" line_length="8">Nor with the Happiness I taste,</l>
     <l n="10" line_length="8">Let any jealous Doubts contend:</l>
     <l n="11" line_length="8">Her Friendship is secure to last,</l>
     <l n="12" line_length="8">Beginning where all others end.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="13" line_length="8">And thou, known Cheat! upheld by Law,</l>
     <l n="14" line_length="8">Thou Disappointer of the craving Mind,</l>
     <l n="15" line_length="8">BASSETTE, who thy Original dost draw</l>
     <l n="16" line_length="8">From  (by uncertain Seas confin'd);</l>
     <l n="17" line_length="8">Author of Murmurs, and of Care,</l>
     <l n="18" line_length="8">Of pleasing Hopes, concluding in Despair:</l>
     <l n="19" line_length="8">To thee my strange Felicity I owe,</l>
     <l n="20" line_length="8">From thy Oppression did this Succour flow.</l>
     <l n="21" line_length="8">Less had I gain'd, had'st thou propitious been,</l>
     <l n="22" line_length="8">Who better by my Loss hast taught me how to Win.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="23" line_length="8">Yet tell me, my transported Brain!</l>
     <l n="24" line_length="8">(whose Pride this Benefit awakes)</l>
     <l n="25" line_length="8">Know'st thou, what on this Chance depends?</l>
     <l n="26" line_length="8">And are we not exalted thus in vain,</l>
     <l n="27" line_length="8">Whilst we observe the Money which she lends,</l>
     <l n="28" line_length="8">But not, alas! the Heart she takes,</l>
     <l n="29" line_length="8">The fond Engagements, and the Ties</l>
     <l n="30" line_length="8">Her fatal Bounty does impose,</l>
     <l n="31" line_length="8">Who makes Reprisals, with her Eyes,</l>
     <l n="32" line_length="8">For what her gen'rous Hand bestows?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="33" line_length="8">And tho' I quickly can return</l>
     <l n="34" line_length="8">Those useful Pieces, which she gave;</l>
     <l n="35" line_length="8">Can I again, or wou'd I have</l>
     <l n="36" line_length="8">That which her Charms have from me borne?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="37" line_length="8">Yet let us quit th' obliging Score;</l>
     <l n="38" line_length="8">And whilst we borrow'd Gold restore,</l>
     <l n="39" line_length="8">Whilst readily we own the Debt,</l>
     <l n="40" line_length="8">And Gratitude before her set</l>
     <l n="41" line_length="8">In its approv'd and fairest Light;</l>
     <l n="42" line_length="8">Let her effectually be taught</l>
     <l n="43" line_length="8">By that instructive, harmless Slight,</l>
     <l n="44" line_length="8">That also in  turn she ought</l>
     <l n="45" line_length="8">(Repaying ev'ry tender Thought)</l>
     <l n="46" line_length="8">Kindness with Kindness to requite.</l>
