     <l n="1">WHat art thou,  which ev'ry thing dost ape?</l>
     <l n="2">Thou  to abus'd Mankind,</l>
     <l n="3">Who never yet thy real Cause cou'd find,</l>
     <l n="4">Or fix thee to remain in one continued Shape.</l>
     <l n="5">Still varying thy perplexing Form,</l>
     <l n="6">Now a Dead Sea thou'lt represent,</l>
     <l n="7">A Calm of stupid Discontent,</l>
     <l n="8">Then, dashing on the Rocks wilt rage into a Storm.</l>
     <l n="9">Trembling sometimes thou dost appear,</l>
     <l n="10">Dissolv'd into a Panick Fear;</l>
     <l n="11">On Sleep intruding dost thy Shadows spread,</l>
     <l n="12">Thy gloomy Terrours round the silent Bed,</l>
     <l n="13">And croud with boading Dreams the Melancholy Head:</l>
     <l n="14">Or, when the Midnight Hour is told,</l>
     <l n="15">And drooping Lids thou still dost waking hold,</l>
     <l n="16">Thy fond Delusions cheat the Eyes,</l>
     <l n="17">Before them antick Spectres dance,</l>
     <l n="18">Unusual Fires their pointed Heads advance,</l>
     <l n="19">And airy Phantoms rise.</l>
     <l n="20">Such was the monstrous  seen,</l>
     <l n="21">When  (now beneath his Cares opprest,</l>
     <l n="22">And all  Fortunes rolling in his Breast,</l>
     <l n="23">Before  latest Field,</l>
     <l n="24">Before his Fate did to  lead)</l>
     <l n="25">Was vanquish'd by the</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="26">Falsly, the Mortal Part we blame</l>
     <l n="27">Of our deprest, and pond'rous Frame,</l>
     <l n="28">Which, till the First degrading Sin</l>
     <l n="29">Let Thee, its dull Attendant, in,</l>
     <l n="30">Still with the Other did comply,</l>
     <l n="31">Nor clogg'd the Active Soul, dispos'd to fly,</l>
     <l n="32">And range the Mansions of it's native Sky.</l>
     <l n="33">Nor, whilst in his own Heaven he dwelt,</l>
     <l n="34">Whilst Man his Paradice possest,</l>
     <l n="35">His fertile Garden in the fragrant East,</l>
     <l n="36">And all united Odours smelt,</l>
     <l n="37">No armed Sweets, until thy Reign,</l>
     <l n="38">Cou'd shock the Sense, or in the Face</l>
     <l n="39">A flusht, unhandsom Colour place.</l>
     <l n="40">Now the  o'ercomes the feeble Brain;</l>
     <l n="41">We faint beneath the Aromatick Pain,</l>
     <l n="42">Till some offensive Scent thy Pow'rs appease,</l>
     <l n="43">And Pleasure we resign for short, and nauseous Ease.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="44">In ev'ry One thou dost possess,</l>
     <l n="45">New are thy Motions, and thy Dress:</l>
     <l n="46">Now in some Grove a list'ning Friend</l>
     <l n="47">Thy false Suggestions must attend,</l>
     <l n="48">Thy whisper'd Griefs, thy fancy'd Sorrows hear,</l>
     <l n="49">Breath'd in a Sigh, and witness'd by a Tear;</l>
     <l n="50">Whilst in the light, and vulgar Croud,</l>
     <l n="51">Thy Slaves, more clamorous and loud,</l>
     <l n="52">By Laughters unprovok'd, thy Influence too confess.</l>
     <l n="53">In the Imperious  thou Vapours art,</l>
     <l n="54">Which from o'erheated Passions rise</l>
     <l n="55">In Clouds to the attractive Brain,</l>
     <l n="56">Until descending thence again,</l>
     <l n="57">Thro' the o'er-cast, and show'ring Eyes,</l>
     <l n="58">Upon her Husband's soften'd Heart,</l>
     <l n="59">He the disputed Point must yield,</l>
     <l n="60">Something resign of the contested Field;</l>
     <l n="61">Till Lordly  born to Imperial Sway,</l>
     <l n="62">Compounds for Peace, to make that Right away,</l>
     <l n="63">And  arm'd with  do's servilely Obey.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="64">The  to imitate the Wits,</l>
     <l n="65">Complains of thy pretended Fits,</l>
     <l n="66">And Dulness, born with him, wou'd lay</l>
     <l n="67">Upon thy accidental Sway;</l>
     <l n="68">Because, sometimes, thou dost presume</l>
     <l n="69">Into the ablest Heads to come:</l>
     <l n="70">That, often, Men of Thoughts refin'd,</l>
     <l n="71">Impatient of unequal Sence,</l>
     <l n="72">Such slow Returns, where they so much dispense,</l>
     <l n="73">Retiring from the Croud, are to thy Shades inclin'd.</l>
     <l n="74">O'er me alas! thou dost too much prevail:</l>
     <l n="75">I feel thy Force, whilst I against thee rail;</l>
     <l n="76">I feel my Verse decay, and my crampt Numbers fail.</l>
     <l n="77">Thro' thy black Jaundice I all Objects see,</l>
     <l n="78">As Dark, and Terrible as Thee,</l>
     <l n="79">My Lines decry'd, and my Employment thought</l>
     <l n="80">An useless Folly, or presumptuous Fault:</l>
     <l n="81">Whilst in the  Paths I stray,</l>
     <l n="82">Whilst in their Groves, and by their secret Springs</l>
     <l n="83">My Hand delights to trace unusual Things,</l>
     <l n="84">And deviates from the known, and common way;</l>
     <l n="85">Nor will in fading Silks compose</l>
     <l n="86">Faintly th' inimitable</l>
     <l n="87">Fill up an ill-drawn  or paint on Glass</l>
     <l n="88">The  blurr'd and undistinguish'd Face,</l>
     <l n="89">The threatning  and the speaking</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="90">Patron thou art to ev'ry gross Abuse,</l>
     <l n="91">The sullen  feign'd Excuse,</l>
     <l n="92">When the ill Humour with his Wife he spends,</l>
     <l n="93">And bears recruited Wit, and Spirits to his Friends.</l>
     <l n="94">The Son of  pleads thy Pow'r,</l>
     <l n="95">As to the Glass he still repairs,</l>
     <l n="96">Pretends but to remove thy Cares,</l>
     <l n="97">Snatch from thy Shades one gay, and smiling Hour,</l>
     <l n="98">And drown thy Kingdom in a purple Show'r.</l>
     <l n="99">When the  whom ev'ry Fool admires,</l>
     <l n="100">Wou'd in Variety be Fair,</l>
     <l n="101">And, changing hastily the Scene</l>
     <l n="102">From Light, Impertinent, and Vain,</l>
     <l n="103">Assumes a soft, a melancholy Air,</l>
     <l n="104">And of her Eyes rebates the wand'ring Fires,</l>
     <l n="105">The careless Posture, and the Head reclin'd,</l>
     <l n="106">The thoughtful, and composed Face,</l>
     <l n="107">Proclaiming the withdrawn, the absent Mind,</l>
     <l n="108">Allows the Fop more liberty to gaze,</l>
     <l n="109">Who gently for the tender Cause inquires;</l>
     <l n="110">The Cause, indeed, is a Defect in Sense,</l>
     <l n="111">Yet is the  alledg'd, and still the dull Pretence.</l>
     <l n="112">But these are thy fantastick Harms,</l>
     <l n="113">The Tricks of thy pernicious Stage,</l>
     <l n="114">Which do the weaker Sort engage;</l>
     <l n="115">Worse are the dire Effects of thy more pow'rful Charms.</l>
     <l n="116">By Thee  all we know,</l>
     <l n="117">That shou'd enlighten here below,</l>
     <l n="118">Is veil'd in Darkness, and perplext</l>
     <l n="119">With anxious Doubts, with endless Scruples vext,</l>
     <l n="120">And some Restraint imply'd from each perverted Text.</l>
     <l n="121">Whilst  not,  not, what is freely giv'n,</l>
     <l n="122">Is but thy niggard Voice, disgracing bounteous Heav'n.</l>
     <l n="123">From Speech restrain'd, by thy Deceits abus'd,</l>
     <l n="124">To Desarts banish'd, or in Cells reclus'd,</l>
     <l n="125">Mistaken Vot'ries to the Pow'rs Divine,</l>
     <l n="126">Whilst they a purer Sacrifice design,</l>
     <l n="127">Do but the  obey, and worship at thy Shrine.</l>
     <l n="128">In vain to chase thee ev'ry Art we try,</l>
     <l n="129">In vain all Remedies apply,</l>
     <l n="130">In vain the  Leaf infuse,</l>
     <l n="131">Or the parch'd  Berry bruise;</l>
     <l n="132">Some pass, in vain, those Bounds, and nobler Liquors use.</l>
     <l n="133">Now  in vain, we bring,</l>
     <l n="134">Inspire the Flute, and touch the String.</l>
     <l n="135">From Harmony no help is had;</l>
     <l n="136">but soothes thee, if too sweetly sad,</l>
     <l n="137">And if too light, but turns thee gayly Mad.</l>
     <l n="138">Tho' the Physicians greatest Gains,</l>
     <l n="139">Altho' his growing Wealth he sees</l>
     <l n="140">Daily encreas'd by Ladies Fees,</l>
     <l n="141">Yet dost thou baffle all his studious Pains.</l>
     <l n="142">Not skilful  thy Source cou'd find,</l>
     <l n="143">Or thro' the well-dissected Body trace</l>
     <l n="144">The secret, the mysterious ways,</l>
     <l n="145">By which thou dost surprize, and prey upon the Mind.</l>
     <l n="146">Tho' in the Search, too deep for Humane Thought,</l>
     <l n="147">With unsuccessful Toil he wrought,</l>
     <l n="148">'Till thinking Thee to've catch'd, Himself by thee was caught,</l>
     <l n="149">Retain'd thy Pris'ner, thy acknowledg'd Slave,</l>
     <l n="150">And sunk beneath thy Chain to a lamented Grave.</l>
