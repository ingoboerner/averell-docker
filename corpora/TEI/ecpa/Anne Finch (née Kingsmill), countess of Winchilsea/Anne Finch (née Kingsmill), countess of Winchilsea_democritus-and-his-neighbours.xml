     <l n="1">IN Vulgar Minds what Errors do arise!</l>
     <l n="2">How diff'ring are the Notions, they possess,</l>
     <l n="3">From theirs, whom better Sense do's bless,</l>
     <l n="4">Who justly are enroll'd amongst the Learn'd and Wise!</l>
     <l n="5">whilst he all Science taught,</l>
     <l n="6">Was by his foolish Neighbours thought</l>
     <l n="7">Distracted in his Wits;</l>
     <l n="8">Who call his speculative Flights,</l>
     <l n="9">His solitary Walks in starry Nights,</l>
     <l n="10">But wild and frantick Fits.</l>
     <l n="11">Bless me, each cries, from such a working Brain!</l>
     <l n="12">And to  they send</l>
     <l n="13">The Sage's long-acquainted Friend,</l>
     <l n="14">To put in Tune his jarring Mind again,</l>
     <l n="15">And Pericranium mend.</l>
     <l n="16">Away the Skilful  comes</l>
     <l n="17">Of Recipes and Med'cines full,</l>
     <l n="18">To check the giddy Whirl of Nature's Fires,</l>
     <l n="19">If so th' unruly Case requires;</l>
     <l n="20">Or with his Cobweb-cleansing Brooms</l>
     <l n="21">To sweep and clear the over-crouded Scull,</l>
     <l n="22">If settl'd Spirits flag, and make the Patient dull.</l>
     <l n="23">But asking what the Symptoms were,</l>
     <l n="24">That made 'em think he was so bad?</l>
     <l n="25">The Man indeed, they cry'd, is wond'rous Mad.</l>
     <l n="26">You, at this Distance, may behold him there</l>
     <l n="27">Beneath that Tree in open Air,</l>
     <l n="28">Surrounded with the Engines of his Fate,</l>
     <l n="29">The Gimcracks of a broken Pate.</l>
     <l n="30">Those  a Sphere he calls,</l>
     <l n="31">That  the Earth;</l>
     <l n="32">And when into his raving Fit he falls,</l>
     <l n="33">'Twou'd move at once your Pity, and your Mirth,</l>
     <l n="34">To hear him, as you will do soon,</l>
     <l n="35">Declaring, there's a Kingdom in the Moon;</l>
     <l n="36">And that each Star, for ought he knows,</l>
     <l n="37">May some Inhabitants enclose:</l>
     <l n="38">Philosophers, he says, may there abound,</l>
     <l n="39">Such Jugglers as himself be in them found;</l>
     <l n="40">Which if there be, the World may well turn round;</l>
     <l n="41">At least to those, whose Whimsies are so strange,</l>
     <l n="42">That, whilst they're fixt to one peculiar Place,</l>
     <l n="43">Pretend to measure far extended Space,</l>
     <l n="44">And 'mongst the Planets range.</l>
     <l n="45">Behold him now contemplating that Head,</l>
     <l n="46">From which long-since both Flesh, and Brains are fled;</l>
     <l n="47">Questioning, if that empty, hollow Bowl</l>
     <l n="48">Did not ere while contain the Human Soul:</l>
     <l n="49">Then starts a Doubt, if 'twere not to the Heart</l>
     <l n="50">That Nature rather did that Gift impart.</l>
     <l n="51">Good Sir, employ the utmost of your Skill,</l>
     <l n="52">To make him Wiser, tho' against his Will;</l>
     <l n="53">Who thinks, that he already All exceeds,</l>
     <l n="54">And laughs at our most solemn Words and Deeds:</l>
     <l n="55">Tho' once amongst us he wou'd try a Cause,</l>
     <l n="56">And Bus'ness of the Town discuss,</l>
     <l n="57">Knowing, as well as one of us,</l>
     <l n="58">The Price of Corn, and standing Market-Laws;</l>
     <l n="59">Wou'd bear an Office in his Turn,</l>
     <l n="60">For which good Purposes all Men were born;</l>
     <l n="61">Not to be making Circles in the Sand,</l>
     <l n="62">And scaling Heav'n, till they have sold their Land.</l>
     <l n="63">Or, when unstock'd below their Pasture lies,</l>
     <l n="64">To find out Bulls and Rams, amidst the Skies.</l>
     <l n="65">From these Mistakes his Madness we conclude;</l>
     <l n="66">And hearing, you was with much Skill endu'd,</l>
     <l n="67">Your Aid we sought.  amaz'd,</l>
     <l n="68">Now on the Sage, now on the Rabble gaz'd;</l>
     <l n="69">And whilst he needless finds his artful Rules,</l>
     <l n="70">Pities a Man of Sense, judg'd by a Croud of Fools</l>
     <l n="71" />
     <l n="72" />
     <l n="73">Peoples  Divine?</l>
