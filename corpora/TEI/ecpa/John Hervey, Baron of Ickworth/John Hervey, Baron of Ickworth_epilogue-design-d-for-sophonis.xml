    <lg n="1" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="1" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">BEFORE you sign poor Sophonisba's doom,</l>
     <l n="2" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">In her behalf petitioner I come;</l>
     <l n="3" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Not but our author knows, whate'er I say,</l>
     <l n="4" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">That I could find objections to his play.</l>
     <l n="5" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">This double marriage for her country's good,</l>
     <l n="6" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">I told him never would be understood,</l>
     <l n="7" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">And that ye all would say, 'twas flesh and blood.</l>
     <l n="8" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Had Carthage only been in madam's head,</l>
     <l n="9" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Her champion never had been in her — bed:</l>
     <l n="10" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">For could the ideot think a husband's name</l>
     <l n="11" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Would make him quit his interest, friends and fame;</l>
     <l n="12" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">That he would risque a kingdom for a wife,</l>
     <l n="13" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">And act dependent in a place for life?</l>
     <l n="14" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Yet when stern Cato shall condemn the fair,</l>
     <l n="15" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Whilst publick good she thunder'd in your ear,</l>
     <l n="16" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">If private interest had a  share.</l>
     <l n="17" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">You know, she acted not against the laws</l>
     <l n="18" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Of those old-fashion'd times; that in her cause</l>
     <l n="19" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Old Syphax could no longer make a stand,</l>
     <l n="20" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">And Massinissa woo'd her sword in hand.</l>
     <l n="21" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">But did not take the way to whet that sword;</l>
     <l n="22" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Heroes fight coldly when wives give the word.</l>
     <l n="23" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">She should have kept him keen, employ'd her charms</l>
     <l n="24" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Not as a bribe, but to reward his arms;</l>
     <l n="25" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Have told him when Rome yielded she would yield,</l>
     <l n="26" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">And sent him fresh, not yawning, to the field.</l>
     <l n="27" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">She talk'd it well to rouse him to the fight,</l>
     <l n="28" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">But like Penelope, when out of sight,</l>
     <l n="29" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">All she had done by day, undid by night.</l>
     <l n="30" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Is this your wily Carthaginian kind?</l>
     <l n="31" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">No English woman had been half so kind.</l>
     <l n="32" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">What from a husband's hand could she expect</l>
     <l n="33" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">But ratsbane, or that common fate, neglect</l>
     <l n="34" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Perhaps some languishing soft fair may say,</l>
     <l n="35" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Poyson's so shocking — but consider pray,</l>
     <l n="36" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">She fear'd the Roman, he the marriage chain;</l>
     <l n="37" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">All other means to free them both were vain.</l>
     <l n="38" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Let none then Massinissa's conduct blame,</l>
     <l n="39" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">He first his love consulted, then his fame.</l>
     <l n="40" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">And if the fair one with too little art,</l>
     <l n="41" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Whilst seemingly she play'd a patriot-part,</l>
     <l n="42" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Was secretly the dupe of her own heart;</l>
     <l n="43" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Forgive a fault she strove so well to hide,</l>
     <l n="44" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Nor be compassion to her fate deny'd,</l>
     <l n="45" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="10">Who liv'd unhappily, and greatly dy'd.</l>
