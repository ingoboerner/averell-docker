     <l n="1">LIGHT of the World, and Ruler of the Year,</l>
     <l n="2">With happy Speed begin thy great Career;</l>
     <l n="3">And as the Radiant Journey's run</l>
     <l n="4">Where e're thy Beams are spread, where e're thy Power is known,</l>
     <l n="5">Through all the distant Nations own,</l>
     <l n="6">That in Fair  thou hast seen</l>
     <l n="7">The Greatest Prince, the Brightest Queen,</l>
     <l n="8">That ever Sav'd a People, ever Grac'd a Throne.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">So may Thy God-head be confest,</l>
     <l n="10">So the returning Year be Blest,</l>
     <l n="11">As its Infant Months bestow</l>
     <l n="12">Springing Wreaths for  Brow;</l>
     <l n="13">As its Summer's Youth shall shed</l>
     <l n="14">Eternal Sweets round  Head:</l>
     <l n="15">From the Blessings They shall know,</l>
     <l n="16">Our Times are Dated, and our  move,</l>
     <l n="17">They Govern, and Enlighten all below</l>
     <l n="18">As Thou do'st all above.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="19">Let our Heroe in the War</l>
     <l n="20">Active and Fierce like Thee, appear;</l>
     <l n="21">Like Thee, Great Son of  like Thee,</l>
     <l n="22">When clad in rising Majesty</l>
     <l n="23">Thou Marchest down o'er  Hills confest,</l>
     <l n="24">With all thy Arrows Arm'd, with all thy Glory Drest.</l>
     <l n="25">Like Thee, the Heroe, does his Arms imploy,</l>
     <l n="26">The raging  to destroy,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="27">From Ancient Times Historic Stores</l>
     <l n="28">Gather all the smiling Hours,</l>
     <l n="29">All that with Friendly Care have guarded</l>
     <l n="30">Patriots and Kings in Rightful Wars,</l>
     <l n="31">All that with Conquest have rewarded</l>
     <l n="32">His Great Fore-fathers Pious Cares,</l>
     <l n="33">All that Story have Recorded</l>
     <l n="34">Sacred to  long Renown,</l>
     <l n="35">For Countries Sack'd and Battels Won.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="36">March Them again in fair Array,</l>
     <l n="37">And bid Them form the Happy Day,</l>
     <l n="38">The Happy Day design'd to wait</l>
     <l n="39">On  Fame, and  Fate.</l>
     <l n="40">Let the Happy Day be Crown'd</l>
     <l n="41">With great Event and fair Success,</l>
     <l n="42">No brighter in the Year be found,</l>
     <l n="43">But that which brings the Victor home in Peace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="44">Again Thy God-head we implore,</l>
     <l n="45">(Great in Wisdom as in Power)</l>
     <l n="46">Again for  sake and ours,</l>
     <l n="47">Chuse out other smiling Hours,</l>
     <l n="48">Such as with lucky Wings have fled</l>
     <l n="49">When Happy Counsels were advising,</l>
     <l n="50">Such as have glad Omens shed</l>
     <l n="51">O'er forming Laws and Empires rising;</l>
     <l n="52">Such as many Lustres ran</l>
     <l n="53">Hand in Hand a goodly Train,</l>
     <l n="54">To bless the Great  Reign,</l>
     <l n="55">And in the Typic Glory show</l>
     <l n="56">The fuller Bliss which  should bestow.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="57">As the Graver Hours advance,</l>
     <l n="58">Mingled send into the Dance,</l>
     <l n="59">Many fraught with all the Treasures</l>
     <l n="60">Which the  Travel views,</l>
     <l n="61">Many wing'd with all the Pleasures</l>
     <l n="62">Man can ask, or Heav'n diffuse.</l>
     <l n="63">To ease the Cares which for Her Subjects sake</l>
     <l n="64">The Pious Queen does with glad Patience take.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="65" />
     <l n="66" />
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="67">For Thy own Glory sing our Sov'raign's Praise</l>
     <l n="68">(God of Verses and of Days)</l>
     <l n="69">Let all Thy Tuneful Sons adorn</l>
     <l n="70">Their lasting Work with  Name,</l>
     <l n="71">Let chosen Muses yet unborn</l>
     <l n="72">Take  Goodness for their Theam:</l>
     <l n="73">Eternal Structures let Them raise</l>
     <l n="74">On  and on  Praise,</l>
     <l n="75">Nor want new Subjects for the Song,</l>
     <l n="76">Nor fear They can exhaust the Store,</l>
     <l n="77">Till Nature's Musick lies unstrung,</l>
     <l n="78">Till Thou shalt shine no more.</l>
