     <l n="1">AS through  Raging Sea,</l>
     <l n="2">Our Great Defender Plowed his Glorious Way,</l>
     <l n="3">To make our Wishes, and his Fame compleat,</l>
     <l n="4">To fix a new our sinking State,</l>
     <l n="5">And fill the great Decrees of Fate.</l>
     <l n="6">turn'd the Mistick Book,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="7">In which Recorded lies the certain Doom</l>
     <l n="8">Of Time unborn, and Years to come;</l>
     <l n="9">Auspicious Omens thence he took,</l>
     <l n="10">Lawrel adorn'd his Brow, and Joy his Look;</l>
     <l n="11">Aloud he Blest the happy Day,</l>
     <l n="12">Whose lustre twice returned must see,</l>
     <l n="13">Truth Restored, and  Free.</l>
     <l n="14">Aloud he bad the mighty Months proceed,</l>
     <l n="15">All Deck'd with fair Success, and Crowned with happy Deed.</l>
     <l n="16">He Smil'd, and struck the Lyre and said,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="17">Heaven has Revers'd  Doom:</l>
     <l n="18">Her promised Day appears, her better Fate is come.</l>
     <l n="19">The gentle Star, whose joyful Ray,</l>
     <l n="20">Enliven'd this Auspicious Day,</l>
     <l n="21">When  blest the Hero's Birth,</l>
     <l n="22">Doth with diffusive Goodness shed,</l>
     <l n="23">It's larger Gifts, o're  rising Head,</l>
     <l n="24">And thence, around the Joyful Earth.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="25">Ye Sacred Muses, whose Harmonious lays</l>
     <l n="26">Are destin'd to Record his Praise.</l>
     <l n="27">Prepare with Solemn Joy, prepare</l>
     <l n="28">The chearful Consort of the War:</l>
     <l n="29">Awake the Trumpets, rouze the Drums,</l>
     <l n="30">The King, the Conqueror, the Hero comes,</l>
     <l n="31">With shining Arms he decks the listed Fields,</l>
     <l n="32">They,  yeilds,</l>
     <l n="33">Bless the Conqueror,</l>
     <l n="34">Put all thy Glory on, exert thy Power;</l>
     <l n="35">And greet thy  happy Toil,</l>
     <l n="36">Assert the Sea, defend the Isles,</l>
     <l n="37">And on the lower World look safely down,</l>
     <l n="38">Thy Self a World alone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="39">See on the Continent appear,</l>
     <l n="40">Engaging Troops and ready War.</l>
     <l n="41">On Foreign Plains the British Armies shine,</l>
     <l n="42">leads on, and Victory pursues,</l>
     <l n="43">And on  Banks the Hero well renews</l>
     <l n="44">The Glories of the</l>
     <l n="45">Deliver'd  dreading now no more,</l>
     <l n="46">Tyrannick Might, and Lawless Power,</l>
     <l n="47">Obeys her Antient Conqueror.</l>
     <l n="48">O're  freed Victorious  Reigns,</l>
     <l n="49">And sullen War, and vanquishe'd Pride,</l>
     <l n="50">Behind his Chariot Wheels are Tied</l>
     <l n="51">In Everlasting Chains.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="52">Bid the Drums and Trumpets cease,</l>
     <l n="53">And Tune the softer Instruments of Peace;</l>
     <l n="54">All that through Speaking Pipes convey</l>
     <l n="55">Sounds of Delight, and Images of Joy;</l>
     <l n="56">All that by Artful Charms, or Vocal Wires,</l>
     <l n="57">In happy Numbers gently can Express,</l>
     <l n="58">All the Pleasure, all the Bliss,</l>
     <l n="59">That  Cares Deserve, or  Love Requires.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="60">now no longer Fear</l>
     <l n="61">The doubtful Chance of horrid war;</l>
     <l n="62">No longer Arm thy Hero with thy Prayer;</l>
     <l n="63">To Battle he no more shall Ride,</l>
     <l n="64">No more for Thee, and His  Bleed.</l>
     <l n="65">Ages are renewed, and Golden Times succeed:</l>
     <l n="66">The shinning Years begin their happy Race,</l>
     <l n="67">With Conquest Crown'd, and Blest with Peace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="68">Fair Plenty opens wide her bounteous Hand,</l>
     <l n="69">And throws her Gifts o're all the Land.</l>
     <l n="70">Virtue does with Heaven conspire,</l>
     <l n="71">To make  Joys entire,</l>
     <l n="72">Whilst  and whilst  Reign.</l>
     <l n="73">has forsook the Stars,</l>
     <l n="74">And joyned her Throne to Theirs,</l>
     <l n="75">Nor shall return from Earth again,</l>
     <l n="76">Whilst  and whilst  Reign.</l>
