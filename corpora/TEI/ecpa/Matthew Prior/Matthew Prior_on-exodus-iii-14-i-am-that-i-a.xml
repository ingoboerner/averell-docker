     <l n="1">Foolish Man!</l>
     <l n="2">Scarce know'st Thou how thy self began:</l>
     <l n="3">Scarce hast Thou Thought enough to prove Thou art:</l>
     <l n="4">Yet steel'd with study'd Boldness, Thou dar'st try</l>
     <l n="5">To send thy doubting Reason's dazled Eye</l>
     <l n="6">Through the mysterious Gulph of vast Immensity.</l>
     <l n="7">Much Thou canst there discern, much thence impart.</l>
     <l n="8">Vain Wretch! suppress thy knowing Pride:</l>
     <l n="9">Mortifie thy learned Lust:</l>
     <l n="10">Vain are thy Thoughts; while Thou thy self are Dust.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="11">Let Wit her Sails, her Oars let Wisdom lend:</l>
     <l n="12">The Helm let Politick Experience guide:</l>
     <l n="13">Yet cease to hope thy short-liv'd Bark shall ride</l>
     <l n="14">Down spreading Fate's unnavigable Tide.</l>
     <l n="15">What, tho' still it farther tend?</l>
     <l n="16">Still 'tis farther from it's End;</l>
     <l n="17">And, in the Bosom of that boundless Sea,</l>
     <l n="18">Still finds it's Error lengthen with it's Way.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="19">With daring Pride and insolent Delight</l>
     <l n="20">Your Doubts resolv'd you boast, your Labours crown'd;</l>
     <l n="21">And, EYPHKA! your GOD, forsooth, is found</l>
     <l n="22">Incomprehensible and Infinite.</l>
     <l n="23">But is He therefore found? Vain Searcher! no:</l>
     <l n="24">Let your imperfect Definition show,</l>
     <l n="25">That nothing You, the weak Definer, know.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="26">Say, why should the collected Main</l>
     <l n="27">It self within it self contain?</l>
     <l n="28">Why to its Caverns should it sometimes creep,</l>
     <l n="29">And with delighted Silence sleep</l>
     <l n="30">On the lov'd Bosom of it's Parent Deep?</l>
     <l n="31">Why shou'd it's num'rous Waters stay</l>
     <l n="32">In comely Discipline, and fair Array,</l>
     <l n="33">'Till Winds and Tides exert their high Commands?</l>
     <l n="34">Then prompt and ready to obey,</l>
     <l n="35">Why do the rising Surges spread</l>
     <l n="36">Their op'ning Ranks o'er Earth's submissive Head,</l>
     <l n="37">Marching thro' different Paths to different Lands?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="38">Why does the constant Sun</l>
     <l n="39">With measur'd Steps his radiant Journeys run?</l>
     <l n="40">Why does He order the Diurnal Hours</l>
     <l n="41">To leave Earth's other Part, and rise in Our's?</l>
     <l n="42">Why does He wake the correspondent Moon,</l>
     <l n="43">And fill her willing Lamp with liquid Light,</l>
     <l n="44">Commanding Her with delegated Pow'rs</l>
     <l n="45">To beautifie the World, and bless the Night?</l>
     <l n="46">Why does each animated Star</l>
     <l n="47">Love the just Limits of it's proper Sphere?</l>
     <l n="48">Why does each consenting Sign</l>
     <l n="49">With prudent Harmony combine</l>
     <l n="50">In Turns to move, and subsequent appear</l>
     <l n="51">To gird the Globe, and regulate the Year?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="52">Man does with dangerous Curiosity</l>
     <l n="53">These unfathom'd Wonders try:</l>
     <l n="54">With fancy'd Rules and arbitrary Laws</l>
     <l n="55">Matter and Motion He restrains;</l>
     <l n="56">And study'd Lines, and fictious Circles draws:</l>
     <l n="57">Then with imagin'd Soveraignty</l>
     <l n="58">Lord of his new  He reigns.</l>
     <l n="59">He reigns? How long? 'till some Usurper rise:</l>
     <l n="60">And He too, mighty thoughtful, mighty wise,</l>
     <l n="61">Studies new Lines, and other Circles feigns.</l>
     <l n="62">From this last Toil again what Knowledge flows?</l>
     <l n="63">Just as much, perhaps, as shows,</l>
     <l n="64">That all his Predecessor's Rules</l>
     <l n="65">Were empty , all  of the Schools;</l>
     <l n="66">That he on t'other's Ruin rears his Throne;</l>
     <l n="67">And shows his Friend's Mistake, and thence confirms his own.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="68">On Earth, in Air, amidst the Seas and Skies,</l>
     <l n="69">Mountainous Heaps of Wonders rise;</l>
     <l n="70">Whose tow'ring Strength will ne'er submit</l>
     <l n="71">To Reason's Batt'ries, or the Mines of Wit:</l>
     <l n="72">Yet still enquiring, still mistaking Man,</l>
     <l n="73">Each Hour repuls'd, each Hour dare onward press;</l>
     <l n="74">And levelling at GOD his wand'ring Guess</l>
     <l n="75">(That feeble Engine of his reasoning War,</l>
     <l n="76">Which guides his Doubts, and combats his Despair)</l>
     <l n="77">Laws to his Maker the learn'd Wretch can give;</l>
     <l n="78">Can bound that Nature, and prescribe that Will,</l>
     <l n="79">Whose pregnant Word did either Ocean fill;</l>
     <l n="80">Can tell us whence all  are, and how they move and live.</l>
     <l n="81">Thro' either Ocean (foolish Man!)</l>
     <l n="82">That pregnant Word sent forth again,</l>
     <l n="83">Might to a World extend each  there;</l>
     <l n="84">For every Drop call forth a Sea, a Heav'n for every Star.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="85">Let cunning Earth her fruitful Wonders hide;</l>
     <l n="86">And only lift thy stagg'ring Reason up</l>
     <l n="87">To trembling  astonish'd Top:</l>
     <l n="88">Then mock thy Knowledge, and confound thy Pride,</l>
     <l n="89">Explaining how Perfection suffer'd Pain;</l>
     <l n="90">Almighty languish'd; and Eternal dy'd:</l>
     <l n="91">How by her Patient Victor Death was slain;</l>
     <l n="92">And Earth prophan'd, yet bless'd with Deicide.</l>
     <l n="93">Then down with all thy boasted Volumes, down:</l>
     <l n="94">Only reserve the Sacred One:</l>
     <l n="95">Low, reverently low,</l>
     <l n="96">Make thy stubborn Knowledge bow;</l>
     <l n="97">Weep out thy Reason's, and thy Body's Eyes;</l>
     <l n="98">Deject thy self, that Thou may'st rise;</l>
     <l n="99">To look to Heav'n, be blind to all below.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="100">Then Faith, for Reason's glimmering Light, shall give</l>
     <l n="101">Her Immortal Perspective;</l>
     <l n="102">And Grace's Presence Nature's Loss retrieve:</l>
     <l n="103">Then thy enliven'd Soul shall see,</l>
     <l n="104">That all the Volumes of Philosophy,</l>
     <l n="105">With all their Comments, never cou'd invent</l>
     <l n="106">So politick an Instrument,</l>
     <l n="107">To reach the Heav'n of Heav'ns, the high Abode,</l>
     <l n="108">Where  places his Mysterious GOD,</l>
     <l n="109">As was that Ladder which old  rear'd,</l>
     <l n="110">When Light Divine had human Darkness clear'd;</l>
     <l n="111">And his enlarg'd Ideas found the Road,</l>
     <l n="112">Which Faith had dictated, and Angels trod.</l>
