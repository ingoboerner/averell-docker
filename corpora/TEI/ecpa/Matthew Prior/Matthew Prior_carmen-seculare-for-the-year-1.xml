     <l n="2">Into the long Records of Ages past:</l>
     <l n="3">Review the Years in fairest Action drest</l>
     <l n="4">With noted White, Superior to the rest;</l>
     <l n="5">deriv'd, and Chronicles begun</l>
     <l n="6">From Empires founded, and from Battels won:</l>
     <l n="7">Show all the Spoils by valiant Kings achiev'd,</l>
     <l n="8">And groaning Nations by Their Arms reliev'd;</l>
     <l n="9">The Wounds of Patriots in their Country's Cause,</l>
     <l n="10">And happy Pow'r sustain'd by wholesom Laws:</l>
     <l n="11">In comely Rank call ev'ry Merit forth:</l>
     <l n="12">Imprint on ev'ry Act it's Standard Worth:</l>
     <l n="13">The glorious Parallels then downward bring</l>
     <l n="14">To Modern Wonders, and to  King:</l>
     <l n="15">With equal Justice and Historic Care</l>
     <l n="16">Their Laws, Their Toils, Their Arms with His compare:</l>
     <l n="17">Confess the various Attributes of Fame</l>
     <l n="18">Collected and compleat in  Name:</l>
     <l n="19">To all the list'ning World relate</l>
     <l n="20">(As Thou dost His Story read)</l>
     <l n="21">That nothing went before so Great,</l>
     <l n="22">And nothing Greater can succeed.</l>

    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="23">Thy Native  was Thy darling Care,</l>
     <l n="24">Prudent in Peace, and terrible in War:</l>
     <l n="25">The boldest Virtues that have govern'd Earth</l>
     <l n="26">From  fruitful Womb derive their Birth.</l>
     <l n="27">Then turn to Her fair-written Page:</l>
     <l n="28">From dawning Childhood to establish'd Age,</l>
     <l n="29">The Glories of Her Empire trace:</l>
     <l n="30">Confront the Heroes of Thy  Race:</l>
     <l n="31">And let the justest Palm the Victor's Temples grace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="32">The Son of  reduc'd the trembling Swains,</l>
     <l n="33">And spread His Empire o'er the distant Plains:</l>
     <l n="34">But yet the  violated Charms</l>
     <l n="35">Obscur'd the Glory of His rising Arms.</l>
     <l n="36">the Rights of strict Religion knew;</l>
     <l n="37">On ev'ry Altar laid the Incense due;</l>
     <l n="38">Unskill'd to dart the pointed Spear,</l>
     <l n="39">Or lead the forward Youth to noble War.</l>
     <l n="40">Stern  was with too much Horror good,</l>
     <l n="41">Holding his  stain'd with Filial Blood.</l>
     <l n="42">was Wise, but with Excess of Care;</l>
     <l n="43">He sav'd his Country; but prolonged the War:</l>
     <l n="44">While  greatly fought;</l>
     <l n="45">And by Their strict Examples taught,</l>
     <l n="46">How wild Desires should be controll'd;</l>
     <l n="47">And how much brighter Virtue was, than Gold;</l>
     <l n="48">They scarce Their swelling Thirst of Fame could hide;</l>
     <l n="49">And boasted Poverty with too much Pride.</l>
     <l n="50">Excess in Youth made  less rever'd:</l>
     <l n="51">And  dying seem'd to own, He fear'd.</l>
     <l n="52">with Honor tam'd  foreign Foes:</l>
     <l n="53">But Patriots fell, e'er the Dictator rose.</l>
     <l n="54">And while with Clemency  reign'd;</l>
     <l n="55">The Monarch was ador'd; the City chain'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="56">With justest Honour be Their Merits drest:</l>
     <l n="57">But be Their Failings too confest:</l>
     <l n="58">Their Virtue, like their  Flood</l>
     <l n="59">Rolling, it's Course design'd the Country's Good:</l>
     <l n="60">But oft the Torrent's too impetuous Speed</l>
     <l n="61">From the low Earth tore some polluting Weed:</l>
     <l n="62">And with the Blood of  there always ran</l>
     <l n="63">Some viler Part, some Tincture of the Man.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="64">Few Virtues after These so far prevail,</l>
     <l n="65">But that Their Vices more than turn the Scale:</l>
     <l n="66">Valour grown wild by Pride, and Pow'r by Rage,</l>
     <l n="67">Did the true Charms of Majesty impair:</l>
     <l n="68">by Degrees advancing more in Age,</l>
     <l n="69">Show'd sad Remains of what had once been fair;</l>
     <l n="70">'Till Heav'n a better Race of Men supplies;</l>
     <l n="71">And Glory shoots new Beams from Western Skies.</l>

     <l n="77">The bold , and  bring;</l>
     <l n="78">Illustrious Virtues, who by turns have rose,</l>
     <l n="79">In foreign Fields to check  Foes;</l>
     <l n="80">With happy Laws Her Empire to sustain,</l>
     <l n="81">And with full Pow'r assert Her ambient Main:</l>
     <l n="82">But sometimes too Industrious to be Great,</l>
     <l n="83">Nor Patient to expect the Turns of Fate,</l>
     <l n="84">They open'd Camps deform'd by Civil Fight,</l>
     <l n="85">And made proud Conquest trample over Right:</l>
     <l n="86">Disparted  mourn'd Their doubtful Sway,</l>
     <l n="87">And dreaded Both, when Neither would obey.</l>

     <l n="97">Undaunted Minds, that rul'd the rugged North;</l>
     <l n="98">'Till Heav'n's Decrees by rip'ning Times are shown;</l>
     <l n="99">'Till  Kings ascend the  Throne;</l>
