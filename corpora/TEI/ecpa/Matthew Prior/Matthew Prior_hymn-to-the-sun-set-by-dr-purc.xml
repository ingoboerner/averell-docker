    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">of the World, and Ruler of the Year,</l>
     <l n="2">With happy Speed begin Thy great Career;</l>
     <l n="3">And, as Thou dost thy radiant Journeys run,</l>
     <l n="4">Through every distant Climate own,</l>
     <l n="5">That in fair  Thou hast seen</l>
     <l n="6">The greatest Prince, the brightest Queen,</l>
     <l n="7">That ever sav'd a Land, or blest a Throne,</l>
     <l n="8">Since first Thy Beams were spread, or Genial Power was known.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">So may Thy Godhead be confest;</l>
     <l n="10">So the returning Year be blest;</l>
     <l n="11">As His Infant Months bestow</l>
     <l n="12">Springing Wreaths for  Brow;</l>
     <l n="13">As His Summer's Youth shall shed</l>
     <l n="14">Eternal Sweets around  Head.</l>
     <l n="15">From the Blessings They bestow,</l>
     <l n="16">Our Times are dated, and our  move:</l>
     <l n="17">They govern, and enlighten all Below,</l>
     <l n="18">As Thou dost all Above.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="19">Let our Hero in the War</l>
     <l n="20">Active and fierce, like Thee, appear:</l>
     <l n="21">Like Thee, great Son of , like Thee,</l>
     <l n="22">When clad in rising Majesty,</l>
     <l n="23">Thou marchest down o'er Hills confest,</l>
     <l n="24">With all Thy Arrows arm'd, in all Thy Glory drest.</l>
     <l n="25">Like Thee, the Hero does his Arms imploy,</l>
     <l n="26">The raging  to destroy,</l>
     <l n="27">And give the injur'd Nations Peace and Joy.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="28">From fairest Years, and Time's more happy Stores,</l>
     <l n="29">Gather all the smiling Hours;</l>
     <l n="30">Such as with friendly Care have guarded</l>
     <l n="31">Patriots and Kings in rightful Wars;</l>
     <l n="32">Such as with Conquest have rewarded</l>
     <l n="33">Triumphant Victors happy Cares;</l>
     <l n="34">Such as Story has recorded</l>
     <l n="35">Sacred to  long Renown,</l>
     <l n="36">For Countries sav'd, and Battels won.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="37">March Them again in fair Array,</l>
     <l n="38">And bid Them form the happy Day,</l>
     <l n="39">The happy Day design'd to wait</l>
     <l n="40">On  Fame, and  Fate.</l>
     <l n="41">Let the happy Day be crown'd</l>
     <l n="42">With great Event, and fair Success;</l>
     <l n="43">No brighter in the Year be found,</l>
     <l n="44">But That which brings the Victor home in Peace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="45">Again Thy Godhead We implore,</l>
     <l n="46">Great in Wisdom as in Power;</l>
     <l n="47">Again, for good  Sake, and Our's,</l>
     <l n="48">Chuse out other smiling Hours,</l>
     <l n="49">Such as with Joyous Wings have fled,</l>
     <l n="50">When happy Counsels were advising;</l>
     <l n="51">Such as have lucky Omens shed</l>
     <l n="52">O'er forming Laws, and Empires rising;</l>
     <l n="53">Such as many Courses ran,</l>
     <l n="54">Hand in Hand, a goodly Train,</l>
     <l n="55">To bless the great  Reign;</l>
     <l n="56">And in the  Glory show,</l>
     <l n="57">What fuller Bliss  shall bestow.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="58">As the solemn Hours advance,</l>
     <l n="59">Mingled send into the Dance</l>
     <l n="60">Many fraught with all the Treasures,</l>
     <l n="61">Which Thy Eastern Travels views;</l>
     <l n="62">Many wing'd with all the Pleasures,</l>
     <l n="63">Man can ask, or Heav'n diffuse:</l>
     <l n="64">That great  all those Joys may know,</l>
     <l n="65">Which, from Her Cares, upon Her Subjects flow.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="66">For Thy own Glory sing our Soveraign's Praise,</l>
     <l n="67">God of Verses and of Days:</l>
     <l n="68">Let all Thy tuneful Sons adorn</l>
     <l n="69">Their lasting Work with  Name:</l>
     <l n="70">Let chosen Muses yet unborn</l>
     <l n="71">Take great  for their future Theme:</l>
     <l n="72">Eternal Structures let Them raise,</l>
     <l n="73">On  and  Praise:</l>
     <l n="74">Nor want new Subject for the Song;</l>
     <l n="75">Nor fear they can exhaust the Store;</l>
     <l n="76">'Till Nature's Musick lyes unstrung;</l>
     <l n="77">'Till Thou, great God, shalt lose Thy double Pow'r;</l>
     <l n="78">And touch Thy Lyre, and shoot Thy Beams no more.</l>
