     <l n="1">and  this as fair</l>
     <l n="2">As Flower, that fresh as Evening Air;</l>
     <l n="3">One HOLY-MORNING had in head,</l>
     <l n="4">To trip to  roie Mead.</l>
     <l n="5">He one hand laid in Bosom bare:</l>
     <l n="6">Her Cloaths fast fluttered in Air.</l>
     <l n="7">Sang he and whistled ore the SWEARD:</l>
     <l n="8">She limber leap'd, as blith as Bird.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">O dainty Violet! said he,</l>
     <l n="10">Simp'ring, and stooping on the LEA,</l>
     <l n="11">Thee little Lass, ah happy thee!</l>
     <l n="12">Adown her Bosom letten be.</l>
     <l n="13">Then, for he'd give a MEY the Flower,</l>
     <l n="14">The Stripling kist it o're and o're.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="15">was meek and sweet of Mein;</l>
     <l n="16">Tender as Evening Air ybeen.</l>
     <l n="17">Soothly, a-frosty Morns she'll set</l>
     <l n="18">Her WINDOW ope, and much of Meat:</l>
     <l n="19">Then, oh how she will cherrup fair,</l>
     <l n="20">The gentle BIRDS out eager Air.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="21">Thus merry the two triped it:</l>
     <l n="22">I can but smile to think how sweet!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="23">Strait  step'd afore, to see</l>
     <l n="24">The where the softest Seat might be.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="25">Abie  yspread's a BOUGH,</l>
     <l n="26">The sweetest sure the Bee doth know.</l>
     <l n="27">There use the Shepherds fresh yfare,</l>
     <l n="28">To bay their Bosoms in cool Air;</l>
     <l n="29">And sip the Dew off SWEET-BREER ROSE:</l>
     <l n="30">There often  too goes.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="31">Now, sweet the Swain here lay at ease;</l>
     <l n="32">Waiting the Lilly-footen Lass.</l>
     <l n="33">She, slim-made PRETTY ONE, her hied</l>
     <l n="34">Over the Green, as brisk as Bride.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="35">Her fine Dew-laping VEST, with Care,</l>
     <l n="36">One Hand did hold; one Flowerets fair</l>
     <l n="37">A-bosom put, soft Paps emong,</l>
     <l n="38">As soft, as Drop on Hawthorn hung.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="39">The Shepherd saw her far away;</l>
     <l n="40">And sweet she sliggar'd by my Fay!</l>
     <l n="41">Then simpering said, as came anigh;</l>
     <l n="42">Oh what a merry Lass am I!</l>
     <l n="43">He'll pick 'em all out, when doth see,</l>
     <l n="44">While I with's RINGLET HAIR may play!</l>
     <l n="45">He'll say I'm sweeter, pick each Flower;</l>
     <l n="46">So I shall play amost an Hour!</l>
     <l n="47">Well was it ween'd now by my Fay;</l>
     <l n="48">O what a merry Lass am I!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="49">Now they're together set so sweet,</l>
     <l n="50">How shall I say how soft and sweet!</l>
     <l n="51">The Swainet ope's his BREAST to th' Air;</l>
     <l n="52">And calls his Love to fan it fair.</l>
     <l n="53">Then for her Pains her Lip soft smack's,</l>
     <l n="54">And right's and smooth's her HONEY-LOCKS.</l>
     <l n="55">Sooth, now the Lass gan like a Kiss;</l>
     <l n="56">But claps her dimple Cheek to his,</l>
     <l n="57">And whisper's soft, MUCH Marl I how,</l>
     <l n="58">thou can'st love kissing so.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="59">Thus lovely lay the gentle PAIR,</l>
     <l n="60">Soft as the Mid-day :</l>
     <l n="61">Strait  rises, and will hie</l>
     <l n="62">To gather STRAWBERRYS abie.</l>
     <l n="63">I prethee, said she, smiling sweet,</l>
     <l n="64">Stay here, and here I'll see thee strait.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="65">She goes: The Shepherd ill can brook,</l>
     <l n="66">To lose the Pleasance of her LOOK.</l>
     <l n="67">But rose anon; and Flowers gan pick,</l>
     <l n="68">Aside a Spring, her Breast to deck.</l>
     <l n="69">Then down agen sate on the SOFT;</l>
     <l n="70">And look'd for  oft and oft.</l>
     <l n="71">O me! How fine a Flower is this;</l>
     <l n="72">Sooth she shan't ha't without a Kiss!</l>
     <l n="73">Elig'ring he said; and pleas'd himself,</l>
     <l n="74">That he should please his darling ELF.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="75">Thus long he sate; still wondring why</l>
     <l n="76">She came not; but she then was by;</l>
     <l n="77">The Lass stood by; stood 'hind a BOUGH;</l>
     <l n="78">Laughing, to think what he would do,</l>
     <l n="79">When found the came not. Now, she sain,</l>
     <l n="80">Had I the Heart to give him Pain!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="81">I've heard say, I know not,</l>
     <l n="82">Love dearer be the dearer bought.</l>
     <l n="83">A little whit howe're I'll wait;</l>
     <l n="84">'Twill pain him but a little whit.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="85">The gentle Shepherd easeless was;</l>
     <l n="86">Turning and shifting on the GRASS.</l>
     <l n="87">When  saw he, YOUNGLING-LASS,</l>
     <l n="88">Soft of Heart and fair of Face.</l>
     <l n="89">Full far away he saw, and ran</l>
     <l n="90">To know if  she had seen;</l>
     <l n="91">And walk'd awith her, grieved sore,</l>
     <l n="92">Till his own DEAR could see no more.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16">
     <l n="93">When  saw, a-thro' her BOUGH,</l>
     <l n="94">The fair-framed he to  go;</l>
     <l n="95">Ah God, how yearn'd the harmless Heart!</l>
     <l n="96">How griev'd, that she should give him smart!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17">
     <l n="97">But when he out of sight did go,</l>
     <l n="98">Alass, she knew not what to do.</l>
     <l n="99">For shamed after him to run,</l>
     <l n="100">Thinking he now was angry grown.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18">
     <l n="101">With pretty carefulness in Face,</l>
     <l n="102">Walk'd, ne knew where, the dainty Lass.</l>
     <l n="103">Nought minding now her little CADE;</l>
     <l n="104">Though't stop't her, as afore her plaid.</l>
     <l n="105">Ne when she made Mouth bleed with kick,</l>
     <l n="106">Left it, but soft her Footen lick.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="19">
     <l n="107">Poor FOOL! It stay her would, tho' whip'd;</l>
     <l n="108">Mayseem it lack'd so sore be lip'd.</l>
     <l n="109">For't used lye in LAP elong,</l>
     <l n="110">And touch her Bosom with the Tongue.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="20">
     <l n="111">Thus rov'd the dainty-leged Lass,</l>
     <l n="112">All till the EVE drew on apace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="21">
     <l n="113">The Swain so soft (for soft be Swains)</l>
     <l n="114">Who pipes so pretty on the Plains;</l>
     <l n="115">I need'nt tell ye who he is,</l>
     <l n="116">The Lasses know him by his KISS.</l>
     <l n="117">At Eve did come, with YOUNGLING MEY.</l>
     <l n="118">A-to the Grove where  lay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="22">
     <l n="119">The why he hither came was this;</l>
     <l n="120">he won to take a Kiss:</l>
     <l n="121">I'll have, quoth she, a SONG for th' Kiss;</l>
     <l n="122">Thou sha't, quoth he, and one for this.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="23">
     <l n="123">So here they came, as did befall,</l>
     <l n="124">To sing elong with NIGHTINGALE.</l>
     <l n="125">Here Violets ypicketh he,</l>
     <l n="126">To deck the bosom of the MEY.</l>
     <l n="127">When lo! he hear's a murmuring tone;</l>
     <l n="128">May seem some Young Lass made her moan.</l>
     <l n="129">Never will I, full well ywis,</l>
     <l n="130">Give pain agen! I've paid for this.</l>
     <l n="131">Oh, if he leaven love, ah god!</l>
     <l n="132">How shall I name a thing so bad?</l>
     <l n="133">Oh, if he leave to love farewell,</l>
     <l n="134">Farewell for ever, ought but Ill!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="24">
     <l n="135">Heav'd the Swain's Breast for pity oft,</l>
     <l n="136">Unhappy Swain to be so soft!</l>
     <l n="137">Ached his Heart, to hear her smart,</l>
     <l n="138">Unhappy Swain to have such Heart!</l>
     <l n="139">Ynethered he creeps anear,</l>
     <l n="140">Still as a Spirit or as Air.</l>
     <l n="141">But could not well tell where she lay,</l>
     <l n="142">'Mongst many a Breer and many a Tree,</l>
     <l n="143">Which dusk'd in GLOOM Moon's waining Ray;</l>
     <l n="144">Ah  how there can'st thou lay!</l>
     <l n="145">A Stream half closed a Plat of Grass;</l>
     <l n="146">And made a sweet a pleasant Place.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="25">
     <l n="147">Here (woe-the-worse!) as nigh drew he,</l>
     <l n="148">He saw what made him sad to see.</l>
     <l n="149">A gentle Lass a-neath a BOUGH:</l>
     <l n="150">Should gentle Lass be laid so low?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="26">
     <l n="151">Twey Lips she had, now sooth I say,</l>
     <l n="152">Like CHERRIES, and as soft as they.</l>
     <l n="153">A dainty Blush on Cheek was too,</l>
     <l n="154">The prettiest Blush, no MEYS blush so.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="27">
     <l n="155">The harmless Shepherd to her sped,</l>
     <l n="156">And took in Arms the harmless Maid.</l>
     <l n="157">But oh! when took in Arms the Lass,</l>
     <l n="158">Witness me God, how wo he was!</l>
     <l n="159">And is it then? and is't quoth he,</l>
     <l n="160">the gentle  I see?</l>
     <l n="161">The dainty Daughter of the GLEN?</l>
     <l n="162">Help me, ye Heavens, to speak my Pain!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="28">
     <l n="163">He stroak'd her Locks, all wet with Mist,</l>
     <l n="164">Out Bosom, then her Bosom kist.</l>
     <l n="165">Why sooth 'twas soft, as Bird in Bush,</l>
     <l n="166">He kist so soft, and bad not blush.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="29">
     <l n="167">Ysoothing breath'd the sweet-lip'd Air</l>
     <l n="168">On pretty Paps, and waved her Hair.</l>
     <l n="169">In VEST her Face she wimpled.</l>
     <l n="170">On tender Bosom hung the Head.</l>
     <l n="171">Tell me, ye gentle STRIPLINGS tell!</l>
     <l n="172">If suiten Lass so lovely wail?</l>
     <l n="173">O tell me! should she, ay or on,</l>
     <l n="174">Letten the Air her VEST yblow?</l>
     <l n="175">Her slender VEST the Air so blew,</l>
     <l n="176">That might see lilly Limbs athro'.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="30">
     <l n="177">was griev'd, ye can't think how,</l>
     <l n="178">To see her soil her Beauty so.</l>
     <l n="179">Her Beauty fresh gan Bloom, and 'ope</l>
     <l n="180">Its bashful Bosom to th' DEW-DROP.</l>
     <l n="181">Her pretty Paps, like clustring Grapes,</l>
     <l n="182">A-thro' her VEST soft show'd their Shapes.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="31">
     <l n="183">Then did the Swain, so fair and fine,</l>
     <l n="184">Ywipe her Tears out pretty Eyen.</l>
     <l n="185">Set her more soft, and soothing sweet,</l>
     <l n="186">Ask'd her how could so fair CHEEKS wet?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="32">
     <l n="187">He chears; but ah! she will no chear;</l>
     <l n="188">Down drops her Head on Bosom bare.</l>
     <l n="189">Chiding the gentle NIGHTINGALE,</l>
     <l n="190">That sang so soft its softest Tale.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="33">
     <l n="191">Then  ask'd het this and that;</l>
     <l n="192">Who gave her grieve? Why so she sate?</l>
     <l n="193">The sloe-eyed SWEET ONE noted none;</l>
     <l n="194">But looked at the waining Moon.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="34">
     <l n="195">Tho' little SPARROW with her was,</l>
     <l n="196">And soft it sate in Neck of Lass.</l>
     <l n="197">Sooth, in her lilly Face 'twould look,</l>
     <l n="198">A pretty fliggar when she spoak.</l>
     <l n="199">See the sweet FON, quoth YOUNGLING-MEY;</l>
     <l n="200">I prethee turn and with it play!</l>
     <l n="201">Alack the Day! quoth  fair,</l>
     <l n="202">The lovely Lad will love elsewhere!</l>
     <l n="203">And clap'd her Face to th' dewie Grass,</l>
     <l n="204">The fairest Face that ever was.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="35">
     <l n="205">The sweet Balm-breathing  chear'd,</l>
     <l n="206">Soft as the Song of EVENING BIRD.</l>
     <l n="207">Then stroaked up the Locks of th' Lass;</l>
     <l n="208">And spoak her thus as gave a kiss.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="36">
     <l n="209">Her dainty CHEEK, with that same Word,</l>
     <l n="210">From off the Green she pertly rear'd.</l>
     <l n="211">But as gan think what she had done,</l>
     <l n="212">Poor HEART down flapped it agen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="37">
     <l n="213">The dabling DEW fell all emong,</l>
     <l n="214">Her buding Breasts so fair and young;</l>
     <l n="215">Her buding Breasts, that bloomie grew,</l>
     <l n="216">Soft shrinked at the dabling DEW.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="38">
     <l n="217">At lenth, howe're, the tender Twey</l>
     <l n="218">Won her to rise from off the LEA.</l>
     <l n="219">Quoth  Prethee to my COTT,</l>
     <l n="220">Let's go; refresh thee there awhit.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="39">
     <l n="221">Oh no, said she, I late did pain</l>
     <l n="222">The loveliest Lad, the sweetest Swain:</l>
     <l n="223">Not for the World! might he not now,</l>
     <l n="224">To know I'm there, be grieved too?</l>
     <l n="225">But thro' the Grove she trip'd it, and</l>
     <l n="226">The Shepherd lead her by the Hand.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="40">
     <l n="227">The gentle Lad, and Lass so fair,</l>
     <l n="228">Thus soft did sooth, for soft they were:</l>
     <l n="229">His Lips gan bloom with tender Hair,</l>
     <l n="230">Her Paps ysprouted fresh and fair.</l>
     <l n="231">At lenth the wailing SWEET ONE they</l>
     <l n="232">Bring where she safe and loose might lay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="41">
     <l n="233">A Cave there is by IDLEHILL,</l>
     <l n="234">Ye know the Place where Shepherds loll:</l>
     <l n="235">There  often goes; I guess,</l>
     <l n="236">To hear the Lark, or toy with Lass.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="42">
     <l n="237">A SWEETBREER dainty o're it spread;</l>
     <l n="238">That Roses bore, and cast a Shade.</l>
     <l n="239">Abie it ran a Rivolet;</l>
     <l n="240">Painted with Sky and Flowers so sweet.</l>
     <l n="241">To this the lilly-finger'd Lass,</l>
     <l n="242">Soft wailing, pointed as did pass.</l>
     <l n="243">May seem she wish'd to set in th' CAVE;</l>
     <l n="244">Her Love might thither hap to rove.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="43">
     <l n="245">Thither the Silver-shapen Lass,</l>
     <l n="246">Soft triped it with easy Pace.</l>
     <l n="247">The SHRUBS afore her sprinkled Dew;</l>
     <l n="248">As easy Air atween 'em flew.</l>
     <l n="249">Thro' Boughs the MOONLIGHT fair beseen,</l>
     <l n="250">Sweet checkered the Grassie Green.</l>
     <l n="251">went first to make the way;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg n="47">
     <l n="271">Come FAIR ONE, be thou like the Roe!</l>
     <l n="272">That leaping o're the HILLS doth go.</l>
     <l n="273">Come down the Gardens, to the Grove!</l>
     <l n="274">We'll hear the TURTLE in his Love.</l>

     <l n="275">FAUNEY ;</l>
     <l n="276">?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="49">
     <l n="277">the Joy of every Lass;</l>
     <l n="278">All meek's his Mind as fair his Face.</l>
     <l n="279">is fresh as EVENING-SKY;</l>
     <l n="280">With small red Mouth and twinkling Eye.</l>

    <lg n="51">
     <l n="283">Thus sang the TWEY their tender Tale;</l>
     <l n="284">Sweet as the Breath of NIGHTINGALE.</l>
     <l n="285">While the fair Wailer lowly laid,</l>
     <l n="286">And hung adown her pretty Head.</l>
     <l n="287">Then  took the Hand of th' Lass,</l>
     <l n="288">And said, soft-smiling in her Face.</l>
     <l n="289">I prethee  go with me!</l>
     <l n="290">Why  far enough away!</l>
     <l n="291">Oh, kind my Lad! Leave ask, quoth she;</l>
     <l n="292">Or bid go lye on yon wet LEA!</l>
     <l n="293">Could I have Heart to pain poor ELE</l>
     <l n="294">And shan't I have to pain my self?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="52">
     <l n="295">She said; small thinking how the while</l>
     <l n="296">was near: Soft did he smile,</l>
     <l n="297">To hear the gentle-hearted Lass</l>
     <l n="298">In VEST she wrapt her lilly Face.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="53">
     <l n="299">Forth crep he soft, of lovely Look;</l>
     <l n="300">Pleas'd as the hunted HART at Brook.</l>
     <l n="301">and  beck'ned first;</l>
     <l n="302">Then claspt his Arms round  WASTE.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="54">
     <l n="303">So loose her held the rosie Boy,</l>
     <l n="304">That she not dreamed any nigh.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="55">
     <l n="305">Anon adown her self she threw,</l>
     <l n="306">And gan to weep and wail anew.</l>
     <l n="307">Ah God! but how she looked then!</l>
     <l n="308">Is it? and is't my gentle SWAIN?</l>
     <l n="309">Like started Hare she leap'd aloft;</l>
     <l n="310">Like easy Sleep he seiz'd her soft.</l>
     <l n="311">Together thro' the WOOD they pass;</l>
     <l n="312">With eachen Lad his pretty Lass.</l>
     <l n="313">Merry as Lamkins on the LEA,</l>
     <l n="314">And well ye know how merry they.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="56">
     <l n="315">So, all is well agen then now,</l>
     <l n="316">as pleas'd as Bird on Bough.</l>
     <l n="317">Then what remains, ye STRIPLINGS, now;</l>
     <l n="318">But that you smile and be so too?</l>
     <l n="319">More bless'd to make's alone in you;</l>
     <l n="320">Can ye dislike what LASSES do?</l>
     <l n="321">Much Wo has had the fairfaced DEAR,</l>
     <l n="322">Do, pity her because she's fair.</l>
