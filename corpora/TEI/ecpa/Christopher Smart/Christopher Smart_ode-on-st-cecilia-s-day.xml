    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">FROM your lyre-enchanted towers,</l>
     <l n="2">Ye musically mystic Powers,</l>
     <l n="3">Ye, that inform the tuneful spheres,</l>
     <l n="4">Inaudible to mortal ears,</l>
     <l n="5">While each orb in ether swims</l>
     <l n="6">Accordant to th' inspiring hymns;</l>
     <l n="7">Hither Paradise remove,</l>
     <l n="8">Spirits of Harmony and Love!</l>
     <l n="9">Thou too, divine Urania, deign to appear,</l>
     <l n="10">And with thy sweetly-solemn lute</l>
     <l n="11">To the grand argument the numbers suit;</l>
     <l n="12">Such as sublime and clear,</l>
     <l n="13">Replete with heavenly love,</l>
     <l n="14">Charm th' inraptur'd souls above.</l>
     <l n="15">Disdainful of fantastic play,</l>
     <l n="16">Mix on your ambrosial tongue</l>
     <l n="17">Weight of sense with sound of song,</l>
     <l n="18">And be angelically gay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="19">And you, ye sons of Harmony below,</l>
     <l n="20">How little less than angels, when ye sing!</l>
     <l n="21">With Emulation's kindling warmth shall glow,</l>
     <l n="22">And from your mellow-modulating throats</l>
     <l n="23">The tribute of your grateful notes</l>
     <l n="24">In union of piety shall bring.</l>
     <l n="25">Shall Echo from her vocal cave</l>
     <l n="26">Repay each note the shepherd gave,</l>
     <l n="27">And shall not we our mistress praise,</l>
     <l n="28">And give her back the borrow'd lays?</l>
     <l n="29">But farther still our praises we pursue;</l>
     <l n="30">For ev'n Cecilia, mighty maid,</l>
     <l n="31">Confess'd she had superior aid —</l>
     <l n="32">She did — and other rites to greater Powers are due:</l>
     <l n="33">Higher swell the sound and higher:</l>
     <l n="34">Let the winged numbers climb:</l>
     <l n="35">To the heaven of heavens aspire,</l>
     <l n="36">Solemn, sacred, and sublime:</l>
     <l n="37">From heaven Music took its rise,</l>
     <l n="38">Return it to its native skies.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="39">Music's a celestial art;</l>
     <l n="40">Cease to wonder at its power,</l>
     <l n="41">Tho' lifeless rocks to motion start,</l>
     <l n="42">Tho' trees dance lightly from the bower,</l>
     <l n="43">Tho' rolling floods in sweet suspence</l>
     <l n="44">Are held, and listen into sense,</l>
     <l n="45">In Penshurst's plains, when Waller, sick with love,</l>
     <l n="46">Has found some silent, solitary grove,</l>
     <l n="47">Where the vague moon-beams pour a silver flood</l>
     <l n="48">Of tremulous light athwart th' unshaven wood,</l>
     <l n="49">Within an hoary moss-grown cell,</l>
     <l n="50">He lays his careless limbs without reserve,</l>
     <l n="51">And strikes, impetuous strikes each querulous nerve</l>
     <l n="52">Of his resounding shell.</l>
     <l n="53">In all the woods, in all the plains,</l>
     <l n="54">Around a lively stillness reigns;</l>
     <l n="55">The deer approach the secret scene,</l>
     <l n="56">And weave their way thro' labyrinths green;</l>
     <l n="57">While Philomela learns the lay,</l>
     <l n="58">And answers from the neighbouring bay.</l>
     <l n="59">But Medway, melancholy mute,</l>
     <l n="60">Gently on his urn reclines,</l>
     <l n="61">And all-attentive to the lute,</l>
     <l n="62">In uncomplaining anguish pines:</l>
     <l n="63">The crystal waters weep away,</l>
     <l n="64">And bear the tidings to the sea:</l>
     <l n="65">Neptune in the boisterous seas</l>
     <l n="66">Spreads the placid bed of peace,</l>
     <l n="67">While each blast,</l>
     <l n="68">Or breathes its last,</l>
     <l n="69">Or just does sigh a symphony and cease.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="70">Behold Arion — on the stern he stands,</l>
     <l n="71">Pall'd in theatrical attire,</l>
     <l n="72">To the mute strings he moves th' enlivening hands,</l>
     <l n="73">Great in distress, and wakes the golden lyre:</l>
     <l n="74">While in a tender Orthian strain</l>
     <l n="75">He thus accosts the mistress of the main:</l>
     <l n="76">By the bright beams of Cynthia's eyes,</l>
     <l n="77">Thro' which your waves attracted rise,</l>
     <l n="78">And actuate the hoary deep;</l>
     <l n="79">By the secret coral cell,</l>
     <l n="80">Where Love, and Joy, and Neptune dwell,</l>
     <l n="81">And peaceful floods in silence sleep;</l>
     <l n="82">By the sea-flowers, that immerge</l>
     <l n="83">Their heads around the grotto's verge,</l>
     <l n="84">Dependent from the stooping stem;</l>
     <l n="85">By each roof-suspended drop,</l>
     <l n="86">That lightly lingers on the top,</l>
     <l n="87">And hesitates into a gem;</l>
     <l n="88">By thy kindred watery gods,</l>
     <l n="89">The lakes, the rivulets, founts and floods,</l>
     <l n="90">And all the Powers that live unseen</l>
     <l n="91">Underneath the liquid green;</l>
     <l n="92">Great Amphitrite (for thou canst bind</l>
     <l n="93">The storm, and regulate the wind)</l>
     <l n="94">Hence waft me, fair Goddess, oh waft me away,</l>
     <l n="95">Secure from the men, and the monsters of prey!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="96">He sung — The winds are charm'd to sleep,</l>
     <l n="97">Soft stillness steals along the deep,</l>
     <l n="98">The Tritons and the Nereids sigh</l>
     <l n="99">In soul-reflecting sympathy,</l>
     <l n="100">And all the audience of waters weep.</l>
     <l n="101">But Amphitrite her dolphin sends — the same,</l>
     <l n="102">Which erst to Neptune brought the nobly perjur'd dame. —</l>
     <l n="103">Pleas'd to obey, the beauteous monster flies,</l>
     <l n="104">And on his scales as the gilt sun-beams play,</l>
     <l n="105">Ten thousand variegated dies</l>
     <l n="106">In copious streams of lustre rise,</l>
     <l n="107">Rise o'er the level main, and signify his way. —</l>
     <l n="108">And now the joyous Bard, in triumph bore,</l>
     <l n="109">Rides the voluminous wave, and makes the wish'd-for shore.</l>
     <l n="110">Come, ye festive, social throng,</l>
     <l n="111">Who sweep the lyre, or pour the song,</l>
     <l n="112">Your noblest melody employ,</l>
     <l n="113">Such as becomes the mouth of Joy;</l>
     <l n="114">Bring the sky-aspiring thought,</l>
     <l n="115">With bright expression richly wrought;</l>
     <l n="116">And hail the Muse ascending on her throne,</l>
     <l n="117">The main at length subdu'd, and all the world her own.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="118">But o'er th' affections too she claims the sway,</l>
     <l n="119">Pierces the human heart, and steals the soul away;</l>
     <l n="120">And as attractive sounds move high or low,</l>
     <l n="121">Th' obedient ductile passions ebb and flow.</l>
     <l n="122">Has any nymph her faithful lover lost,</l>
     <l n="123">And in the visions of the night,</l>
     <l n="124">And all the day-dreams of the light,</l>
     <l n="125">In Sorrow's tempest turbulently tost —</l>
     <l n="126">From her cheeks the roses die,</l>
     <l n="127">The radiations vanish from her sun-bright eye,</l>
     <l n="128">And her breast, the throne of love,</l>
     <l n="129">Can hardly, hardly, hardly move,</l>
     <l n="130">To send th' ambrosial sigh.</l>
     <l n="131">But let the skilful Bard appear,</l>
     <l n="132">And pour the sounds medicinal in her ear:</l>
     <l n="133">Sing some sad, some plaintive ditty,</l>
     <l n="134">Steept in tears that endless flow,</l>
     <l n="135">Melancholy notes of pity,</l>
     <l n="136">Notes that mean a worldof woe;</l>
     <l n="137">She too shall sympathize, she too shall moan,</l>
     <l n="138">And pitying others sorrows sigh away her own.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="139">Wake, wake the kettle-drum, prolong</l>
     <l n="140">The swelling trumpet's silver song,</l>
     <l n="141">And let the kindred accents pass</l>
     <l n="142">Thro' the horn's meandering brass.</l>
     <l n="143">Arise — The patriot Muse invites to war,</l>
     <l n="144">And mounts Bellona's brazen car;</l>
     <l n="145">While Harmony, terrific maid!</l>
     <l n="146">Appears in martial pomp array'd:</l>
     <l n="147">The sword, the target, and the lance</l>
     <l n="148">She wields, and as she moves, exalts the Pyrrhic dance.</l>
     <l n="149">Trembles the earth, resound the skies —</l>
     <l n="150">Swift o'er the fleet, the camp she flies</l>
     <l n="151">With thunder in her voice, and lightning in her eyes.</l>
     <l n="152">The gallant warriors engage</l>
     <l n="153">With inextinguishable rage,</l>
     <l n="154">And hearts unchill'd with fear;</l>
     <l n="155">Fame numbers all the chosen bands,</l>
     <l n="156">Full in the front fair Victory stands,</l>
     <l n="157">And Triumph crowns the rear.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="158">But hark the temple's hollow'd roof resounds,</l>
     <l n="159">And Purcell lives along the solemn sounds. —</l>
     <l n="160">Mellifluous, yet manly too,</l>
     <l n="161">He pours his strains along,</l>
     <l n="162">As from the lion Sampson slew,</l>
     <l n="163">Comes sweetness from the strong.</l>
     <l n="164">Not like the soft Italian swains,</l>
     <l n="165">He trills the weak enervate strains,</l>
     <l n="166">Where Sense and Music are at strife;</l>
     <l n="167">His vigorous notes with meaning teem,</l>
     <l n="168">With fire, with force explain the theme,</l>
     <l n="169">And sing the subject into life.</l>
     <l n="170">Attend — he sings Cecilia — matchless dame!</l>
     <l n="171">'Tis she — 'tis she, — fond to extend her fame,</l>
     <l n="172">On the loud chords the notes conspire to stay,</l>
     <l n="173">And sweetly swell into a long delay,</l>
     <l n="174">And dwell delighted on her name.</l>
     <l n="175">Blow on, ye sacred organs, blow,</l>
     <l n="176">In tones magnificently slow;</l>
     <l n="177">Such is the music, such the lays</l>
     <l n="178">Which suit your fair inventress' praise:</l>
     <l n="179">While round religious silence reigns,</l>
     <l n="180">And loitering winds expect the strains.</l>
     <l n="181">Hail majestic mournful measure,</l>
     <l n="182">Source of many a pensive pleasure!</l>
     <l n="183">Blest pledge of love to mortals given,</l>
     <l n="184">As pattern of the rest of heaven!</l>
     <l n="185">And thou, chief honor of the veil,</l>
     <l n="186">Hail, harmonious virgin, hail!</l>
     <l n="187">When Death shall blot out every name,</l>
     <l n="188">And Time shall break the trump of Fame,</l>
     <l n="189">Angels may listen to thy lute:</l>
     <l n="190">Thy power shall last, thy bays shall bloom,</l>
     <l n="191">When tongues shall cease, and worlds consume,</l>
     <l n="192">And all the tuneful spheres be mute.</l>
