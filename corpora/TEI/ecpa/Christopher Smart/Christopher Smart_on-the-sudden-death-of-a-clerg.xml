    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">IF, like th' Orphean lyre, my song could charm,</l>
     <l n="2">And light to life the ashes in the urn,</l>
     <l n="3">Fate of his iron dart I would disarm,</l>
     <l n="4">Sudden as thy decease should'st thou return,</l>
     <l n="5">Recall'd with mandates of despotic sounds,</l>
     <l n="6">And arbitrary grief, that will not hear of bounds.</l>
     <l n="7">But, ah! such wishes, artless muse, forbear;</l>
     <l n="8">'Tis impotence of frantic love,</l>
     <l n="9">Th' enthusiastic flight of wild despair,</l>
     <l n="10">To hope the Thracian's magic power to prove.</l>
     <l n="11">Alas! thy slender vein,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor mighty is to move, nor forgetive to feign,</l>
     <l n="13">Impatient of a rein,</l>
     <l n="14">Thou canst not in due bounds the struggling measures keep,</l>
     <l n="15">— But thou, alas! canst weep —</l>
     <l n="16">Thou canst — and o'er the melancholy bier</l>
     <l n="17">Canst lend the sad solemnity a tear.</l>
     <l n="18">Hail! to that wretched corse, untenanted and cold,</l>
     <l n="19">And hail the peaceful shade loos'd from its irksome hold.</l>
     <l n="20">Now let me say thou'rt free,</l>
     <l n="21">For sure thou paid'st an heavy tax for life,</l>
     <l n="22">While combating for thee,</l>
     <l n="23">Nature and mortality</l>
     <l n="24">Maintain'd a daily strife.</l>
     <l n="25">High, on a slender thread thy vital lamp was plac'd,</l>
     <l n="26">Upon the mountain's bleakest brow,</l>
     <l n="27">To give a nobler light superior was it rais'd,</l>
     <l n="28">But more expos'd by eminence it blaz'd;</l>
     <l n="29">For not a whistling wind that blew,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor the drop-descending dew,</l>
     <l n="31">Nor a bat that idly flew,</l>
     <l n="32">But half extinguish'd its fair flame — but now</l>
     <l n="33">See — hear the storms tempestuous sweep —</l>
     <l n="34">Precipitate it falls — it falls — falls lifeless in the deep.</l>
     <l n="35">Cease, cease, ye weeping youth,</l>
     <l n="36">Sincerity's soft sighs, and all the tears of truth.</l>
     <l n="37">And you, his kindred throng, forbear</l>
     <l n="38">Marble memorials to prepare,</l>
     <l n="39">And sculptur'd in your breasts his busto wear.</l>
     <l n="40">'Twas thus when Israel's legislator dy'd,</l>
     <l n="41">No fragile mortal honours were supply'd,</l>
     <l n="42">But even a grave denied.</l>
     <l n="43">Better than what the pencil's daub can give,</l>
     <l n="44">Better than all that Phidias ever wrought,</l>
     <l n="45">Is this — that what he taught shall live,</l>
     <l n="46">And what he liv'd for ever shall be taught.</l>
