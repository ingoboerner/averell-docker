    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">BRISK chaunticleer his mattins had begun,</l>
     <l n="2">And broke the silence of the night,</l>
     <l n="3">And thrice he call'd aloud the tardy sun,</l>
     <l n="4">And thrice he hail'd the dawn's ambiguous light;</l>
     <l n="5">Back to their graves the fear-begotten phantoms run.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="6">Strong Labour got up with his pipe in his mouth,</l>
     <l n="7">And stoutly strode over the dale,</l>
     <l n="8">He lent new perfumes to the breath of the south,</l>
     <l n="9">On his back hung his wallet and flail.</l>
     <l n="10">Behind him came Health from her cottage of thatch,</l>
     <l n="11">Where never physician had lifted the latch.</l>
     <l n="12">First of the village Colin was awake,</l>
     <l n="13">And thus he sung, reclining on his rake.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="14">Now the rural graces three</l>
     <l n="15">Dance beneath yon maple tree;</l>
     <l n="16">First the vestal Virtue, known</l>
     <l n="17">By her adamantine zone;</l>
     <l n="18">Next to her in rosy pride,</l>
     <l n="19">Sweet Society, the bride;</l>
     <l n="20">Last Honesty, full seemly drest</l>
     <l n="21">In her cleanly home-spun vest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="22">The abby bells in wak'ning rounds</l>
     <l n="23">The warning peal have giv'n;</l>
     <l n="24">And pious Gratitude resounds</l>
     <l n="25">Her morning hymn to heav'n.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="26">All nature wakes — the birds unlock their throats,</l>
     <l n="27">And mock the shepherd's rustic notes.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="28">All alive o'er the lawn,</l>
     <l n="29">Full glad of the dawn,</l>
     <l n="30">The little lambkins play,</l>
     <l n="31">Sylvia and Sol arise, — and all is day —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="32">Come, my mates, let us work,</l>
     <l n="33">And all hands to the fork,</l>
     <l n="34">While the Sun shines, our Hay-cocks to make,</l>
     <l n="35">So fine is the Day,</l>
     <l n="36">And so fragrant the Hay,</l>
     <l n="37">That the Meadow's as blithe as the Wake.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="38">Our voices let's raise</l>
     <l n="39">In Phoebus's praise,</l>
     <l n="40">Inspir'd by so glorious a theme,</l>
     <l n="41">Our musical words</l>
     <l n="42">Shall be join'd by the birds,</l>
     <l n="43">And we'll dance to the tune of the stream.</l>
