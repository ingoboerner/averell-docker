     <l n="1">SOme Tuneful Being now my Breast inspire</l>
     <l n="2">Gay and Noble as Celestial Fire;</l>
     <l n="3">For  is my Theam;</l>
     <l n="4">But ah in vain born on  Wings,</l>
     <l n="5">My ventrous Muse</l>
     <l n="6">The mighty Aim pursues;</l>
     <l n="7">For to his Native Skies still  mounts and Sings,</l>
     <l n="8">And we are distant still to an extream.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">Behold the  how he keeps aloft;</l>
     <l n="10">While Angels Crowd, and Listen to his Song;</l>
     <l n="11">And not an  in the throng</l>
     <l n="12">That durst correct a Thought.</l>
     <l n="13">So Nobly are they Drest,</l>
     <l n="14">And Gracefully exprest;</l>
     <l n="15">So smoothly glide the Numbers from his Tongue;</l>
     <l n="16">So well his Touch the Charming Strings obey,</l>
     <l n="17">That all his  Admire,</l>
     <l n="18">To hear him weild an equal Theam with as much skill as they.</l>
     <l n="19">His  did even their Harps inspire;</l>
     <l n="20">And the Glad Anthem they repeat agen,</l>
     <l n="21">"Glory to God, Peace and Good-will to Men.</l>
