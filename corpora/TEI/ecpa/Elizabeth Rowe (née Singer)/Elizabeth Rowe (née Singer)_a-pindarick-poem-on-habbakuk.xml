     <l n="1">WHen God from  came,</l>
     <l n="2">And cloath'd in  from Mount-Paran shone,</l>
     <l n="3">Drest in th' unsufferable</l>
     <l n="4">That hides his</l>
     <l n="5">His  soon  the once bright</l>
     <l n="6">And fill'd the trembling  with  and</l>
     <l n="7">Resplondent  did crown his</l>
     <l n="8">And shining  all around him spread;</l>
     <l n="9">he graspt in his strong</l>
     <l n="10">And  stood waiting on his</l>
     <l n="11">Waiting 'till his  he'd</l>
     <l n="12">beneath his  did</l>
     <l n="13">All  did  beneath his</l>
     <l n="14">And with his  he the vast  did mete;</l>
     <l n="15">The frighted  scattered,</l>
     <l n="16">And at his sight the  sled,</l>
     <l n="17">The  their Founder's Voice obey,</l>
     <l n="18">And stoop their  to make th'  way.</l>
     <l n="19">The distant  all  are,</l>
     <l n="20">And  trembling  cannot  their Fear:</l>
     <l n="21">When thy swift  pass'd the yielding</l>
     <l n="22">The  back in  flee,</l>
     <l n="23">Affrighted  stops his</l>
     <l n="24">And bids his forward  back to their  turn.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="25">Arm'd with thy</l>
     <l n="26">Thou marchedst out against thy</l>
     <l n="27">And very  thou didst appear</l>
     <l n="28">To them, but thus thy  cheer.</l>
     <l n="29">"Know,  I am the God of Truth,</l>
     <l n="30">" Your Father  nor  I break my Oath.</l>
     <l n="31">The  as our dread Lord advanc'd,</l>
     <l n="32">And all the little  around 'em</l>
     <l n="33">The neighb'ring  their verdant  o'reflow,</l>
     <l n="34">The  saw and trembled at the</l>
     <l n="35">Back to their  they go,</l>
     <l n="36">And bear the News to</l>
     <l n="37">The  within its hollow  roars.</l>
     <l n="38">And beats the</l>
     <l n="39">The  above no longer dares to strive,</l>
     <l n="40">Nor will his frighted  their wonted  drive.</l>
     <l n="41">The  to see her  stop his</l>
     <l n="42">Grew  and curb'd her  for Fear,</l>
     <l n="43">Thy  gild their</l>
     <l n="44">And at the  of thy  the  dare not stay;</l>
     <l n="45">The very  of thee did them</l>
     <l n="46">And arm'd with  thou the  didst pursue.</l>
     <l n="47">So now, great God, wrapt in avenging</l>
     <l n="48">Meet thine and  and tread them  under.</l>
