     <l n="1">YEs;  But where</l>
     <l n="2">Are this Great Loves Dimensions?</l>
     <l n="3">Even Angels stop; for, baffled here</l>
     <l n="4">Are their vast Apprehensions.</l>
     <l n="5">In vain they strive to Grasp the</l>
     <l n="6">Not all their Comments can explain the mighty Truth I Sing.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="7">Yet still they pause on the Contents</l>
     <l n="8">Of this Amazing Story;</l>
     <l n="9">How he that fill'd the</l>
     <l n="10">Of Uncreated Glory?</l>
     <l n="11">He whom the Heaven of Heavens cou'd not contain;</l>
     <l n="12">Shou'd yet within the Sacred Maids  remain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="13">They see him Born, and hear him Weep,</l>
     <l n="14">To aggravate their Wonder;</l>
     <l n="15">Whose Awful Voice had shook the Deep,</l>
     <l n="16">And Breath'd his Will in Thunder:</l>
     <l n="17">That Awful Voice, chang'd to an  Cry;</l>
     <l n="18">Whilst in a Feeble Woman's Arms he seems constrain'd to lye.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="19">A  (Ah! Where are Humane boasts?)</l>
     <l n="20">Extended in a Manger?</l>
     <l n="21">The Lord of all the Heavenly Hosts</l>
     <l n="22">Expos'd to Scorn and Danger?</l>
     <l n="23">The Onely Blest, the All-sufficient Weeps:</l>
     <l n="24">But Oh, who Guides the  while its Protector Sleeps?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="25">And canst thou Man ungrateful prove.</l>
     <l n="26">When 'twas for thy Salvation,</l>
     <l n="27">He left those Splendid Seats above,</l>
     <l n="28">His late bright Habitation?</l>
     <l n="29">Where all his Deity Shone,</l>
     <l n="30">Of a Seraphick Vehicle, or deficated Clay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="31">Where he Transcendently possest</l>
     <l n="32">The Fullness of Perfection:</l>
     <l n="33">Tho here benighted and opprest,</l>
     <l n="34">The Type of all Dejection.</l>
     <l n="35">He asks for Food, that gave the  Bread;</l>
     <l n="36">And the Great Founder of the World</l>
     <l n="37">where to lay his Head.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="38">But Oh what Dark Catastrophe</l>
     <l n="39">Does Hell at last Conspire!</l>
     <l n="40">Behold! upon a</l>
     <l n="41">The Lord of Life Expire:</l>
     <l n="42">From this, Amaz'd, the Sun withdraws his Eye,</l>
     <l n="43">Maker Bleed, and the Eternal Dye.</l>

     <l n="44">The Seraphims that throng'd about,</l>
     <l n="45">'Twixt Hope and Consternation;</l>
     <l n="46">Now Blaze the Wondrous News throughout</l>
     <l n="47">The Radiant Corporation:</l>
     <l n="48">Who vainly strive the Mistery to scan,</l>
     <l n="49">And Fathom the Stupendious Depths of this</l>
     <l n="50">Great Love to Man.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="51">He on the Rights of Justice stood,</l>
     <l n="52">With their</l>
     <l n="53">That now, through Streams of Sacred Blood</l>
     <l n="54">Wafts the Terrestial Creature;</l>
     <l n="55">Wafts Dusty-Man to that Felicity,</l>
     <l n="56">Which the  of Light must never hope to see.</l>
