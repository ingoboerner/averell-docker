    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">I'VE toucht  each muse I have invok't,</l>
     <l n="2">Yet still the mighty theam,</l>
     <l n="3">Copes my unequal praise;</l>
     <l n="4">Perhaps, the  is provok't.</l>
     <l n="5">I grasp a Subject fit for none but him,</l>
     <l n="6">Or  sweeter lays;</l>
     <l n="7">A name I ne're could yet rehearse,</l>
     <l n="8">But straight my thoughts</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="9">And now methinks I rise;</l>
     <l n="10">But still the  baulks my slight,</l>
     <l n="11">And still my  despairs to do great  right;</l>
     <l n="12">Yet takes the  which I bring,</l>
     <l n="13">The early products of a Female muse;</l>
     <l n="14">Untill  into my breast shall</l>
     <l n="15">When I with more Command, and  shall sing;</l>
     <l n="16">But how shall I describe the matchless men?</l>
     <l n="17">I'm lost in the  agen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="18">When the  as ignorant as accurst,</l>
     <l n="19">Arriv'd in vice and error to the worst,</l>
     <l n="20">And like  banisht from the stage,</l>
     <l n="21">Virtue and Truth were ready</l>
     <l n="22">Their numerous foes,</l>
     <l n="23">Scarce one of eithers Champions ventur'd to oppose;</l>
     <l n="24">Scarce one  durst openly engage,</l>
     <l n="25">To do them right.</l>
     <l n="26">Till prompted with a generous rage;</l>
     <l n="27">You cop't with all th' abuses of the age;</l>
     <l n="28">Unmaskt and  its abhorred crimes,</l>
     <l n="29">Nor fear'd to  the darling vices of the times.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="30">Successfully go on,</l>
     <l n="31">T' inform and bless mankind as you've begun,</l>
     <l n="32">Till like your selves they see;</l>
     <l n="33">The frantick world's imagin'd Joys to be,</l>
     <l n="34">Unmanly, sensual and effeminate,</l>
     <l n="35">Till they with such exalted thoughts possest;</l>
     <l n="36">As you've inspir'd into my</l>
     <l n="37">Are  like me, from the impending fate.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="38">For ah!  I blush to say't,</l>
     <l n="39">I with the vulgar world thought</l>
     <l n="40">Tho fine my breeding, and my Notions high;</l>
     <l n="41">Tho train'd in the  tracts of strictest piety,</l>
     <l n="42">I' like my  soon grew vain,</l>
     <l n="43">And laid my slighted innocence a side;</l>
     <l n="44">Yet oft my nobler thoughts I have bely'd,</l>
     <l n="45">And to be ill was</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="46">Untill by you,</l>
     <l n="47">With more Heroick sentiments inspir'd,</l>
     <l n="48">I turn'd and  the vigorous torrent too,</l>
     <l n="49">And at my former</l>
     <l n="50">So much was I by your</l>
     <l n="51">So much the  did win:</l>
     <l n="52">Which to my eyes</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="53">Oh, could my verse;</l>
     <l n="54">With  to after times rehearse,</l>
     <l n="55">Your  It should as bright and Deathless be;</l>
     <l n="56">As that immortal flame you've rais'd in me.</l>
     <l n="57">A flame which time:</l>
     <l n="58">And Death it self, wants power to controul,</l>
     <l n="59">Not more sublime,</l>
     <l n="60">Is the</l>
     <l n="61">A friendship so exalted and immense,</l>
     <l n="62">A  did ne're before commence.</l>
