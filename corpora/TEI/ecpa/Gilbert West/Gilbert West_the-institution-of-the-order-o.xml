     <l n="4">From the star-pav'd milky way,</l>
     <l n="5">From the moon's relucent horn,</l>
     <l n="6">From the star that wakes the morn;</l>
     <l n="7">From the bow, whose mingling dyes</l>
     <l n="8">Sweetly cheer the frowning skies;</l>
     <l n="9">From the silver cloud that sails</l>
     <l n="10">Shadowy o'er the darken'd vales;</l>

     <l n="57">Who, as ye skim along the sky,</l>
     <l n="58">Dip your light pinions in the main,</l>
     <l n="59">Then shake them fraught with genial show'rs,</l>
     <l n="60">O'er blooming Flora's primrose bow'rs:</l>

     <l n="61">Now cease awhile your wanton sport,</l>

     <l n="67">But lo! fair Windsor's tow'rs appear,</l>
     <l n="68">And hills with spreading oaks imbrown'd!</l>
     <l n="69">Hark! hark! the voice of joy I hear,</l>
     <l n="70">Sung by a thousand echoes round;</l>
     <l n="71">And now I view a glitt'ring train,</l>
     <l n="72">In triumph march o'er yonder plain.</l>

    <lg n="11" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="73">Hail mighty nation! ever fam'd in war!</l>
     <l n="74">Lo! heav'n descends thy festivals to share;</l>
     <l n="75">To view those heroes, whose immortal praise</l>
     <l n="76">Celestial bards shall sing in living lays.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="77">Disdain not, ye blest denizens of air,</l>
     <l n="78">To breathe this grosser atmosphere awhile,</l>
     <l n="79">Your service I shall need; mean time resort</l>
     <l n="80">To yon imperial palace, and in air</l>
     <l n="81">Draw up your squadrons in a radiant orb,</l>
     <l n="82">Suspended o'er those lofty battlements,</l>
     <l n="83">Like the bright halo that invests the moon,</l>
     <l n="84">Or Saturn's lucid ring: thence shed benign</l>
     <l n="85">Your choicest influence on the noble train,</l>
     <l n="86">There on this solemn day assembled round</l>
     <l n="87">The throne of British Edward: I awhile</l>
     <l n="88">Must here await th' approach of other spirits,</l>
     <l n="89">Sage Druids, Britain's old philosophers;</l>
     <l n="90">Fetch'd by my summons from the western isles,</l>
     <l n="91">That, scatter'd o'er the rough Hibernian flood,</l>
     <l n="92">Seem like huge fragments by the wild wave torn</l>
     <l n="93">From stormy Scotland, and the Cambrian shore.</l>
     <l n="94">There, from the world retir'd in secret shades,</l>
     <l n="95">Chiefly where Breint and Meinai wash'd the oaks</l>
     <l n="96">Of ancient Mona, their academies</l>
     <l n="97">And schools of sage and moral discipline</l>
     <l n="98">They held; and to the neighb'ring Britons round,</l>
     <l n="99">From their rever'd tribunals, holy mounts,</l>
     <l n="100">Dispens'd at once their oracles and laws.</l>
     <l n="101">'Till fierce Paulinus, and his Roman bands,</l>
     <l n="102">Them and their gods defying, drove them thence</l>
     <l n="103">To seek for shelter in Hibernian shades.</l>
     <l n="104">Yet still enamour'd of their ancient haunts,</l>
     <l n="105">Unseen of mortal eyes, they hover round</l>
     <l n="106">Their ruin'd altars, consecrated hills</l>
     <l n="107">Once girt with spreading oaks, mysterious rows</l>
     <l n="108">Of rude enormous obelisks, that rise</l>
     <l n="109">Orb within orb, stupendous monuments</l>
     <l n="110">Of artless architecture, such as now</l>
     <l n="111">Oft times amaze the wand'ring traveller,</l>
     <l n="112">By the pale moon discern'd on Sarum's plain.</l>
     <l n="113">But hence, aÃ«rial spirits: lo, they come!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="114">Inform us, happy spirit, protecting pow'r</l>
     <l n="115">Of this our ancient country, wherefore now</l>
     <l n="116">From our sequester'd vallies, pensive groves</l>
     <l n="117">And dark recesses, thou hast summon'd us</l>
     <l n="118">To wait thy orders on this flow'ry hill?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="119">A great event, sage Druids, that no less</l>
     <l n="120">Imports than this your ancient country's fame,</l>
     <l n="121">From contemplation, and your silent shades,</l>
     <l n="122">Calls you to meet me on this flow'ry hill.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="123">Know, in yon castle, whose proud battlements</l>
     <l n="124">Sit like a regal crown upon the brow</l>
     <l n="125">Of high-climbing lawn, doth Edward hold</l>
     <l n="126">This day his solemn session to receive</l>
     <l n="127">The pleas of all th' aspiring candidates,</l>
     <l n="128">Who, summon'd by the herald's publick voice,</l>
     <l n="129">To Windsor, as to Fame's bright temple, haste</l>
     <l n="130">From ev'ry shore; the noble, wise, and brave,</l>
     <l n="131">Knights, senators, and statesmen, lords and kings;</l>
     <l n="132">Ambitious each to gain the splendid prize,</l>
     <l n="133">By Edward promis'd to transcendent worth.</l>
     <l n="134">For who of mortals is too great and high</l>
     <l n="135">In the career of virtue to contend?</l>
     <l n="136">Of these selecting the most glorious names,</l>
     <l n="137">Doth England's monarch purpose to compose</l>
     <l n="138">A princely brotherhood, himself the chief,</l>
     <l n="139">And worthy sov'reign of th' illustrious band;</l>
     <l n="140">A band of heroes, listed in the cause</l>
     <l n="141">Of honour, virtue, and celestial truth,</l>
     <l n="142">Under the name and holy patronage</l>
     <l n="143">Of Cappadocian GEORGE, Britannia's saint.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16">
     <l n="144">Such is the plan by gen'rous Edward form'd;</l>
     <l n="145">A plan of glory, that beyond the reach</l>
     <l n="146">Of his own conquering arms, shall propagate</l>
     <l n="147">The sov'reignty of Britain, and erect</l>
     <l n="148">Her monarchs into judges of mankind.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17">
     <l n="149">But from this day's decisions, from the choice</l>
     <l n="150">Of his first collegues, shall succeeding times</l>
     <l n="151">Of Edward judge, and on his fame pronounce.</l>
     <l n="152">For dignities and titles, when misplac'd</l>
     <l n="153">Upon the vicious, the corrupt and vile,</l>
     <l n="154">Like princely virgins to low peasants match'd,</l>
     <l n="155">Descend from their nobility, and soil'd</l>
     <l n="156">By base alliance, not their pride alone</l>
     <l n="157">And native splendor lose, but shame retort</l>
     <l n="158">Ev'n on the sacred throne, from whence they sprung.</l>
     <l n="159">So may the lustre of this order bright,</l>
     <l n="160">This eldest child of chivalry be stain'd,</l>
     <l n="161">If at her first espousals, her great sire,</l>
     <l n="162">Caught by the specious outsides, that deceive</l>
     <l n="163">And captivate the world, admit the suit</l>
     <l n="164">Of vain pretenders void of real worth;</l>
     <l n="165">Light empty bubbles, by the wanton gale</l>
     <l n="166">Of fortune swell'd, and only form'd to dance</l>
     <l n="167">And glitter in the sun-shine of a court.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18">
     <l n="168">Begin we then with Edward; first let him</l>
     <l n="169">At his own high tribunal undergo</l>
     <l n="170">The rigid inquisition â I for this</l>
     <l n="171">Have left my lucid star-encircled throne:</l>
     <l n="172">For this, immortal sages have requir'd</l>
     <l n="173">Your wise and prudent ministry, well skill'd</l>
     <l n="174">In various science and the human heart.</l>
     <l n="175">Search Edward's to the bottom: sound the depths</l>
     <l n="176">And shallows of his soul; if he possess</l>
     <l n="177">That first of regal talents, to discern</l>
     <l n="178">With quick-ey'd penetration, thro' the veil</l>
     <l n="179">Of art, each character's intrinsick worth,</l>
     <l n="180">And all the labyrinths of the human mind.</l>
     <l n="181">Nor blush for this good end yourselves to wear</l>
     <l n="182">Fallacious forms to plead the cause of false</l>
     <l n="183">But specious merit; at his throne appear</l>
     <l n="184">In borrow'd shapes, and there with artful guile,</l>
     <l n="185">When the shrill trumpet cites the candidates,</l>
     <l n="186">Urge your pretensions: all the pow'r employ</l>
     <l n="187">Of wit and eloquence: Edward, I trust,</l>
     <l n="188">The trial shall abide; which shall but tend</l>
     <l n="189">To manifest, that not from arrogance,</l>
     <l n="190">But conscious virtue, hath he thus assum'd</l>
     <l n="191">Above all other kings, to be the judge</l>
     <l n="192">And great rewarder of heroic deeds.</l>
     <l n="193">Nor wholly unassisted will I leave</l>
     <l n="194">My royal charge, but with blest influence clear</l>
     <l n="195">His intellectual eye from the dim mists</l>
     <l n="196">It haply hath contracted from a long</l>
     <l n="197">Unebbing current of felicity,</l>
     <l n="198">Unhop'd, unequall'd triumphs, from the view</l>
     <l n="199">Of captive monarchs, and the glitt'ring throng,</l>
     <l n="200">Who at his summons from all climates come,</l>
     <l n="201">To take, as from their sov'reign, honours new.</l>
     <l n="202">When heav'n tries mortals in unusual ways,</l>
     <l n="203">'Tis fit it should afford unusual aid.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="19">
     <l n="204">Now, sages, to yon spreading oaks retire</l>
     <l n="205">There wait my summons; and mean time advise</l>
     <l n="206">How best to execute the task enjoin'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="20">
     <l n="207">That hither from your distant residence,</l>
     <l n="208">By solemn invitation, noble guests,</l>
     <l n="209">I have entreated your illustrious train,</l>
     <l n="210">Misconstrue not to levity and pride,</l>
     <l n="211">Or ostentatious vain magnificence,</l>
     <l n="212">Unworthy the grave majesty of kings,</l>
     <l n="213">Unworthy your atention, my renown.</l>
     <l n="214">This bright assemblage of the wise, the brave,</l>
     <l n="215">The noble, the magnificent, the fair,</l>
     <l n="216">The ornaments of Europe, have I sought</l>
     <l n="217">To grace the pomp of Virtue, to adorn</l>
     <l n="218">With noblest off'rings her unspotted shrine,</l>
     <l n="219">Attracting thus to her divine commands</l>
     <l n="220">The aweful veneration of mankind.</l>
     <l n="221">This was the cause, great princes, this the call,</l>
     <l n="222">The voice of Virtue, not of England's king,</l>
     <l n="223">That with respectful zeal ye hear'd and follow'd:</l>
     <l n="224">From Burgundy's rich vineyards, from the meads</l>
     <l n="225">Of Hainault and Brabant, the rocky wave</l>
     <l n="226">Of Danube, from Germania's warlike tow'rs,</l>
     <l n="227">Imperial mother of an hundred states;</l>
     <l n="228">From Spain, long exercis'd by Moorish arms,</l>
     <l n="229">From Italy's fair princedoms, and the walls</l>
     <l n="230">Of sea-wash'd Venice, Adria's haughty spouse.</l>
     <l n="231">With me then, all ye virtuous, by what stile</l>
     <l n="232">Recorded in the registers of fame,</l>
     <l n="233">Knights, senators, or soldiers, ermin'd lords,</l>
     <l n="234">Or scepter'd princes; from whatever clime</l>
     <l n="235">Ye come, ennobled by heroic acts,</l>
     <l n="236">With me unite the splendor of your names</l>
     <l n="237">To dignify th' erection of a new</l>
     <l n="238">And noble order, which to heav'n's high praise,</l>
     <l n="239">And to heav'n's champion Cappadocian GEORGE,</l>
     <l n="240">On this his holy festival I mean</l>
     <l n="241">To found a recompence for worthiest deeds.</l>
     <l n="242">Thus as the orient sun, ador'd of old</l>
     <l n="243">By prostrate Persia, ow'd his deity</l>
     <l n="244">Less to that genial and benignant heat</l>
     <l n="245">That cherishes and warms the seeds of life,</l>
     <l n="246">Than to those gorgeous beams, that deck with gold</l>
     <l n="247">And crimson the gay portals of the morn;</l>
     <l n="248">So shall this rising order owe its fame</l>
     <l n="249">And brightest lustre to the splendid train</l>
     <l n="250">Of lords and purpled princes, who are met</l>
     <l n="251">This day to usher and adorn its birth.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="21">
     <l n="252">Nor deem that to allure heroic minds,</l>
     <l n="253">My private int'rests partially to serve,</l>
     <l n="254">To lift the valiant in ambition's cause,</l>
     <l n="255">And form a league of conquest, I have laid</l>
     <l n="256">In subtle policy this great design:</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="22">
     <l n="257">ASHAM'D BE HE WHO WITH MALIGNANT EYE</l>

     <l n="259">Whoe'er in after-times shall so pervert</l>
     <l n="260">This sacred institution. To the world</l>
     <l n="261">I here consign it, to the good and great</l>
     <l n="262">Of every age and clime, and them alone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="23">
     <l n="263">Now sound the trumpet; bid the candidates</l>
     <l n="264">With confidence appear, and urge their claims.</l>

    <lg n="24">
     <l n="265">Illustrious monarch! emp'ror of the isles!</l>

     <l n="284">These honours undiminish'd, undefil'd,</l>
     <l n="285">To me deliver'd down, might well content</l>
     <l n="286">A vulgar mind; but spirits highly born</l>

     <l n="288">And use the vantage ground of rank and pow'r</l>
     <l n="289">But to ascend still higher. Thus I come</l>
     <l n="290">Thy GARTER to sollicit; pleas'd, great prince,</l>
     <l n="291">With thee to be enroll'd thy brother knight,</l>

     <l n="300">Soars to the courts of heav'n, and perches bold</l>

     <l n="338">It were a kind of treason to my crown,</l>

     <l n="367">The diamond's star-like radiance? Wealth, O king,</l>

     <l n="369">That cherishes, adorns, and calls to view</l>
     <l n="370">These princely flowers of honour, virtue, fame,</l>
     <l n="371">Which in the shades of poverty were lost.</l>
     <l n="372">Whatever men desire or venerate,</l>

     <l n="390">With like pre-eminence exalted shines</l>
     <l n="391">In ev'ry land above the proudest names,</l>

    <lg n="33">
     <l n="393">My birth or rank I boast not here, though born</l>
     <l n="394">A senator of Genoa. The desert,</l>

     <l n="396">To have adorn'd and dignify'd the state</l>
     <l n="397">Of my declining house with greater wealth</l>
     <l n="398">Than e'er my thriftless ancestors possess'd;</l>

     <l n="401">Of some torn ensign, to their needy son</l>
     <l n="402">A worthless heritage. Yet not to swell</l>
     <l n="403">My narrow fortunes wou'd my soul descend</l>
     <l n="404">To the base methods of ignoble trade,</l>
     <l n="405">And vulgar mercantile pursuit of gain.</l>
     <l n="406">Mine were the noble arts of raising gold</l>
     <l n="407">From gold, of nursing and improving wealth</l>
     <l n="408">By gainful use; arts practis'd heretofore</l>
     <l n="409">By senators and sages of old Rome,</l>
     <l n="410">Illustrious Crassus, and wise Seneca.</l>
     <l n="411">Thus have I grac'd the splendor of my name</l>

     <l n="433">Their value they derive; of this to judge,</l>

     <l n="435">Of all refin'd delights. â But chief to kings</l>
     <l n="436">My happy talents I devote; on them</l>
     <l n="437">My genius waits with duteous care, and wafts</l>
     <l n="438">The golden cup of pleasure to their lips,</l>
     <l n="439">Like Ganymede before the throne of Jove.</l>
     <l n="440">And who indeed would wish to be a god</l>
     <l n="441">Only to thunder, and to hear the pray'rs</l>
     <l n="442">Of clam'rous suitors? 'Tis the nectar'd feast,</l>
     <l n="443">The dance of Graces, and the wanton charms</l>
     <l n="444">Of Venus, sporting with the Smiles and Loves,</l>
     <l n="445">That make the court of heav'n a blest abode.</l>
     <l n="446">Far happier were the meanest peasant's lot</l>
     <l n="447">Who sleeps or sings in careless ease beneath</l>
     <l n="448">The sun-burnt hay-cock, or the flow'ry thorn,</l>

     <l n="450">The purple drudge and slave of tiresome state,</l>
     <l n="451">If to superior pow'r superior means</l>
     <l n="452">Of joy were not annex'd, and larger scope</l>
     <l n="453">For ev'ry wish the lavish heart can form:</l>
     <l n="454">If the soft hand of pleasure did not wreathe</l>
     <l n="455">Around the royal diadem, whose weight</l>
     <l n="456">Oppressive loads the monarch's aching brow,</l>
     <l n="457">Her fairest growth of ever-blooming flow'rs.</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="461">One only bliss is wanting to thy court,</l>
     <l n="462">Voluptuous elegance, the lovely child</l>
     <l n="463">Of ease and opulence; that never comes,</l>
     <l n="464">But like a bird of summer to attend</l>
     <l n="465">The brightest sun-shine of a glorious state.</l>
     <l n="466">To her, and her alone belongs the task,</l>
     <l n="467">By learned delicacy to remove</l>
     <l n="468">What yet remains in this thy ancient realm</l>
     <l n="469">Of Gothick barbarism, the rust of war,</l>
     <l n="470">And valiant ignorance. â Her artful hand</l>
     <l n="471">Thy rugged Britons shall refine, and teach</l>
     <l n="472">More courtly manners, to their sov'reign's will</l>
     <l n="473">Politely pliant: do but thou command</l>
     <l n="474">Thy willing servant, with thy favours grac'd,</l>
     <l n="475">From fair Joanna's ever-smiling court,</l>
     <l n="476">Under whose happy influence I was train'd,</l>
     <l n="477">From polish'd Naples, her delightful seat,</l>

     <l n="479">Her train of joys, and fix them here beneath</l>
     <l n="480">Thy great protection. â But perhaps thou fear'st</l>
     <l n="481">The voice of censure, and the grave reproof</l>

     <l n="483">The vulgar herd, indeed, religious craft</l>
     <l n="484">And policy of state have well confin'd</l>
     <l n="485">With wise severity to rigid laws:</l>

     <l n="491">For thee indulgent justice shall relax</l>
     <l n="492">Her harsh decrees, and piety shall wait</l>

     <l n="580">Polite; vice must be sordid and deform'd,</l>
     <l n="581">Tho' to adorn her ev'ry art contend.</l>
     <l n="582">And rather wou'd I see my Britons roam</l>
     <l n="583">Untutor'd savages, among the woods,</l>
     <l n="584">As once they did, in naked innocence,</l>
     <l n="585">Than polish'd like the vile degenerate race</l>
     <l n="586">Of modern Italy's corrupted sons.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="44">
     <l n="587">Nor riches, nor nobility of birth,</l>
     <l n="588">Nor the soft arts of base effem'nate ease,</l>
     <l n="589">Which justly thou rejectest, valiant prince,</l>
     <l n="590">But thy own darling attribute I boast,</l>
     <l n="591">Undaunted courage, try'd in many a field,</l>
     <l n="592">In ev'ry clime, and under ev'ry banner,</l>
     <l n="593">That for these forty summers have been wav'd</l>
     <l n="594">O'er Europe's plains, by Ister, Rhine, and Po,</l>
     <l n="595">Hungarian and Bohemian, Flemish, French,</l>
     <l n="596">Venetian, Spanish, Guelph and Gibbeline:</l>
     <l n="597">Whence in just confidence secure I come</l>
     <l n="598">This military honour to demand,</l>
     <l n="599">Due to my toils and service, to my wounds,</l>
     <l n="600">My laurels, and that generous love of glory,</l>
     <l n="601">Which without any call, or publick cause,</l>
     <l n="602">Or private animosity, alone</l>
     <l n="603">Rais'd my strong arm, and drew my dreadful sword.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="45">
     <l n="604">Wherever Mars his crimson flag display'd,</l>
     <l n="605">That was my country, thither swift I bore</l>
     <l n="606">My ready valour, and the dauntless band</l>
     <l n="607">Of various nations, under my command,</l>
     <l n="608">Prepar'd to sell their blood, their limbs, their lives:</l>
     <l n="609">Nor where the right, nor where the justest cause,</l>
     <l n="610">Deign'd we to ask â those intricate debates</l>
     <l n="611">We left to lazy penmen in the shade</l>
     <l n="612">Of coward ease; while our impetuous fire</l>
     <l n="613">Still bore us forward, ardent to pursue</l>
     <l n="614">Thro' danger's roughest paths the steps to fame.</l>
     <l n="615">On such a spirit should thy favour smile.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="46">
     <l n="616">But let me wonder, Edward, that so long</l>
     <l n="617">Thy ear the vain pretensions cou'd endure</l>
     <l n="618">Of men unknown to war, attendants meet</l>
     <l n="619">Of some luxurious Asiatic court,</l>
     <l n="620">Or female distaff-reign; but suiting ill</l>
     <l n="621">The presence of a monarch great in arms.</l>
     <l n="622">Hadst thou to those inglorious sons of peace</l>
     <l n="623">Thy martial order giv'n, the warrior-saint</l>
     <l n="624">Had blush'd to see his image so profan'd,</l>
     <l n="625">Which on my manly breast, indented o'er</l>
     <l n="626">With many a noble scar, will fitly shine.</l>
     <l n="627">But wherefore stand I thus haranguing here,</l>
     <l n="628">Unskilful as I am in smooth discourse,</l>
     <l n="629">The coward's argument? On force alone</l>
     <l n="630">I rest my title: let the glorious prize</l>
     <l n="631">Be hung on high amid the listed field,</l>
     <l n="632">And let me there dispute it; there my lance</l>
     <l n="633">Shall plead my cause far better than my tongue,</l>
     <l n="634">If any dare deny my rightful claim.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="47">
     <l n="635">Not for the brave alone have I ordain'd</l>
     <l n="636">This institution, but for all desert,</l>
     <l n="637">All publick virtue, wisdom, all that serves,</l>
     <l n="638">Improves, defends, or dignifies a state:</l>
     <l n="639">Tho' first indeed to valour, as the guard</l>
     <l n="640">Of all the rest, when in the publick cause,</l>
     <l n="641">With justice and benevolence employ'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="48">
     <l n="642">But thou, base mercenary, canst thou dare</l>
     <l n="643">The glorious name of valour to usurp,</l>
     <l n="644">Who know'st no publick cause, no sense of right,</l>
     <l n="645">Nor pity, nor affection, nor remorse?</l>
     <l n="646">Who under any chief, in any quarrel,</l>
     <l n="647">Canst stain with gore thy prostituted arms?</l>
     <l n="648">Call it not love of glory; that is built</l>
     <l n="649">On acts for the deliv'rance of mankind;</l>
     <l n="650">On gen'rous principles, and noble scorn</l>
     <l n="651">Of sordid int'rest: call it cruel pride,</l>
     <l n="652">And savageness of nature, that delights</l>
     <l n="653">To conquer, and oppress, afflict, insult;</l>
     <l n="654">Or call it love of plunder, that can draw</l>
     <l n="655">Unauthoris'd, uninjur'd, unprovok'd,</l>
     <l n="656">The sword of war; that bravo-like can lift</l>
     <l n="657">For hire the venal hand to perpetrate</l>
     <l n="658">Assassinations, murders, massacres.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="49">
     <l n="659">But thou hast serv'd with courage: be it so â</l>
     <l n="660">Thou hast thy pay, and with it thy reward;</l>
     <l n="661">Pretend no farther, nor compare thy deeds,</l>
     <l n="662">Dishonour'd by the mean desire of gain,</l>
     <l n="663">With his, who for his country and his king</l>
     <l n="664">Resigns his ease, his fortune, or his life.</l>
     <l n="665">Those battles thou hast fought, those forty years</l>
     <l n="666">Of blood and horror, which thy vaunting tongue</l>
     <l n="667">So high hath sounded, are indeed thy crimes,</l>
     <l n="668">Flagitious crimes; for which th' impartial bar</l>
     <l n="669">Of reason wou'd condemn thee, as the foe</l>
     <l n="670">Of human nature, did not custom screen</l>
     <l n="671">By her unjust esteem thy guilty head.</l>
     <l n="672">But hope not honour or employment here.</l>
     <l n="673">Unsafe and wretched is that monarch's state</l>
     <l n="674">Who weakly trusts to mercenary bands,</l>
     <l n="675">The guard or of his person, or his realm:</l>
     <l n="676">Unfaithful, insolent, rapacious, base</l>
     <l n="677">He soon shall prove them, and become himself</l>
     <l n="678">Their slave, to hold his kingdom at their will.</l>
     <l n="679">For this within my Britain have I sought</l>
     <l n="680">To raise a martial spirit, and ordain'd</l>
     <l n="681">These new incitements, honours, and rewards,</l>
     <l n="682">To virtuous chivalry, that never king</l>
     <l n="683">Who wears hereafter my imperial crown,</l>
     <l n="684">May need to stoop to the precarious aid</l>
     <l n="685">Of venal foreign swords; but in the hearts</l>
     <l n="686">Of his brave subjects find a stronger guard,</l>
     <l n="687">Prepar'd with zeal unbought, and English valour,</l>
     <l n="688">His rights to vindicate, and save their own.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="50">
     <l n="689">Well has thy sovereign wisdom, royal judge,</l>
     <l n="690">The suit refus'd of these pretenders vain,</l>
     <l n="691">And, by rejecting them, embolden'd me.</l>
     <l n="692">For valour, and nobility, and wealth,</l>
     <l n="693">Though by their proud possessors vaunted high,</l>
     <l n="694">Are but subordinate, the slaves and tools,</l>
     <l n="695">Not the companions, and the counsellors</l>
     <l n="696">Of godlike monarchy; whose aweful throne</l>
     <l n="697">By darksome clouds envelop'd, far beyond</l>
     <l n="698">The ken of vulgar eyes, supported stands</l>
     <l n="699">On that deep-rooted prop, the craft of state,</l>
     <l n="700">Mysterious policy. â Who best hath learn'd</l>
     <l n="701">Her wily lessons, best deserves to share</l>
     <l n="702">The honours, counsels, and the hearts of kings.</l>
     <l n="703">By him instructed, ev'n the meanest prince</l>
     <l n="704">Shall rise to envy'd greatness, shall advance</l>
     <l n="705">His dreaded pow'r above restraint and fear,</l>
     <l n="706">And all the rules that in fantastic chains</l>
     <l n="707">Inferior minds confine. Thus Milan's dukes,</l>
     <l n="708">Thus Padua's lords above their country's laws</l>
     <l n="709">Have rais'd their heads, and trampled to the dust</l>
     <l n="710">The pride of freedom, that essays in vain</l>
     <l n="711">Their high superior genius to controul.</l>
     <l n="712">These were my masters, mighty prince; beneath</l>
     <l n="713">Their rule, and in their councils was I form'd</l>
     <l n="714">To know the false corrupted heart of man,</l>
     <l n="715">His ev'ry weakness, ev'ry vice, and thence</l>
     <l n="716">To tempt, or break his passions to the yoke:</l>
     <l n="717">To scorn the publick as an empty name,</l>
     <l n="718">And on the helpless multitude impose</l>
     <l n="719">The adamantine bonds of fraud and force.</l>
     <l n="720">Thus was I train'd, thus fitted to conduct</l>
     <l n="721">The fate of proudest empires; thus I come</l>
     <l n="722">To claim thy GARTER, Edward, the just meed</l>
     <l n="723">Of worth praeeminent, and in return</l>
     <l n="724">My services to offer, which no doubt</l>
     <l n="725">Thy wisdom gladly will accept: for who</l>
     <l n="726">So fit to serve the majesty of kings,</l>
     <l n="727">As he, who slighting ev'ry meaner tye,</l>
     <l n="728">Friends, parents, country, to advance their pow'r</l>
     <l n="729">Devotes his toil, experience, fortune, fame,</l>
     <l n="730">Nor other favour courts, nor refuge hopes</l>
     <l n="731">But in their high protection? â Led by me,</l>
     <l n="732">Thou, royal Edward, shalt attain that height,</l>
     <l n="733">That glorious summit of imperial pow'r,</l>
     <l n="734">Which not thy mighty ancestors have reach'd;</l>
     <l n="735">Where in a freer air, a more enlarg'd</l>
     <l n="736">Horizon, bounded only by thy will,</l>
     <l n="737">Thou shalt exalted sit, and view beneath,</l>
     <l n="738">In humbler distances and safer bounds,</l>
     <l n="739">Those subjects, who presumptuous now approach</l>
     <l n="740">Too near, and with rude hands profane thy throne.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="51">
     <l n="741">Nor let weak scruples check thy manly soul</l>
     <l n="742">In the bright task of glory; know, great prince,</l>
     <l n="743">A king's divinity is sov'reign pow'r,</l>
     <l n="744">The only god, before whose shrine the wise</l>
     <l n="745">Their incense offer, whence inspir'd, they draw</l>
     <l n="746">Divine ambition, and heroic scorn</l>
     <l n="747">Of vulgar prejudices, vulgar fears.</l>
     <l n="748">Virtue's the people's idol, and by them</l>
     <l n="749">Rewarded well with popular applause,</l>
     <l n="750">That idle breath, the gift and prize of fools.</l>
     <l n="751">'Tis thine to govern, not to court mankind,</l>
     <l n="752">Nor on their smiles precarious to depend,</l>
     <l n="753">But nobly force them to depend on thine.</l>
     <l n="754">O sacred sir, can virtue give thee this,</l>
     <l n="755">This bright supremacy? Trust not her boasts,</l>
     <l n="756">Her idle pageanty of barren praise:</l>
     <l n="757">Reject her saucy claims, importunate,</l>
     <l n="758">And self-supported; nor admit her train,</l>
     <l n="759">Proud independency, and publick zeal,</l>
     <l n="760">Those factious demagogues, the foes of kings.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="52">
     <l n="761">Are virtue then, and love of publick good,</l>
     <l n="762">The foes of monarchy? and are deceit,</l>
     <l n="763">Injustice and oppression, qualities</l>
     <l n="764">Becoming and expedient in a king?</l>
     <l n="765">Then know I not to govern; but have nurs'd</l>
     <l n="766">For twice these fifteen years ev'n in my heart,</l>
     <l n="767">A pois'nous viper; nay unking'd myself,</l>
     <l n="768">By yielding to restrain my sov'reign pow'r</l>
     <l n="769">With laws and charters of enfranchisement,</l>
     <l n="770">Not due, it seems, from monarchs to their slaves.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="53">
     <l n="771">But know, vile counsellor of infamy,</l>
     <l n="772">That I disdain thy politics, those false</l>
     <l n="773">And shallow politics, by which my sire,</l>
     <l n="774">Weak judging Edward, was betray'd to shame</l>
     <l n="775">And foul destruction, while to such as thee</l>
     <l n="776">His ear and heart incautious he resign'd,</l>
     <l n="777">And was indeed their slave, not England's king.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="54">
     <l n="778">By maxims different far have I sustain'd</l>
     <l n="779">The strength and splendor of my regal state,</l>
     <l n="780">On the broad basis of true wisdom fix'd</l>
     <l n="781">With solid firmness. By encouraging</l>
     <l n="782">The gen'rous love of virtue and of fame,</l>
     <l n="783">That source of valour, pledge of victory.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="55">
     <l n="784">By granting to my subjects, what indeed</l>
     <l n="785">Is their inherent right, security,</l>
     <l n="786">The cheerful father of content and peace,</l>
     <l n="787">Of industry and opulence, which fills</l>
     <l n="788">With smiling multitudes the land, and pays</l>
     <l n="789">In willing subsidies that prince's care,</l>
     <l n="790">Who lays up treasure in his people's hearts.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="56">
     <l n="791">By holding with a firm impartial hand</l>
     <l n="792">The sleddy scale of justice; not alone</l>
     <l n="793">Betwixt my subjects in their private rights,</l>
     <l n="794">But in the gen'ral, more important cause,</l>
     <l n="795">Betwixt the crown and them, the diff'rent claims</l>
     <l n="796">Of freedom and of just prerogative:</l>
     <l n="797">Transgressing not myself by boundless pow'r,</l>
     <l n="798">Nor suff'ring others to transgress those laws,</l>
     <l n="799">That in their golden chain together bind,</l>
     <l n="800">For common good, the whole united state.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="57">
     <l n="801">But more than all, by guarding from contempt,</l>
     <l n="802">Or impious violation, that supreme</l>
     <l n="803">Protrectress of all government and law,</l>
     <l n="804">Religion; in whose train for ever wait</l>
     <l n="805">Obedience, order, justice, mercy, love,</l>
     <l n="806">A guard of angels plac'd around the throne.</l>
     <l n="807">Her sacred counsels have I still rever'd,</l>
     <l n="808">Her high commands enforc'd, her pow'r implor'd,</l>
     <l n="809">O'er all my subject nations to call down</l>
     <l n="810">From heav'nly wisdom, her eternal fire,</l>
     <l n="811">A fix'd secure felicity, beyond</l>
     <l n="812">The force of human prudence to attain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="58">
     <l n="813">These are my arts of government, those arts</l>
     <l n="814">By which my British crown I have advanc'd</l>
     <l n="815">Above th' imperial diadem, above</l>
     <l n="816">The pride of Afric's, or of Asia's thrones.</l>
     <l n="817">I wou'd not tell thee this, but that thou seem'st</l>
     <l n="818">A stranger to my fame, as to my realm,</l>
     <l n="819">And to the real greatness of a king:</l>
     <l n="820">Whose sacred dignity, by thee traduc'd,</l>
     <l n="821">Much it behoves a king to vindicate;</l>
     <l n="822">Not by rejecting only with disdain</l>
     <l n="823">Thy arrogant pretensions, but in thee</l>
     <l n="824">Dishonouring and branding with reproach</l>
     <l n="825">Thy tenets also, the pernicious lore</l>
     <l n="826">Of tyrants and usurpers, which thy tongue,</l>
     <l n="827">Blaspheming justice, government, and law,</l>
     <l n="828">Hath in a land of freedom dar'd to vent.</l>
     <l n="829">Hence! from my kingdom, with thy quickest speed,</l>
     <l n="830">Lest the revenge of an insulted king</l>
     <l n="831">With sudden ruin intercept thy flight.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="59">
     <l n="832">Behold in us, great king, the ancient priests</l>
     <l n="833">And judges of this land, the Druids old:</l>
     <l n="834">Who late in borrow'd characters have stood</l>
     <l n="835">Before thy sage tribunal, to prefer</l>
     <l n="836">The claims of valour, wealth, nobility,</l>
     <l n="837">And those soft specious flatt'rers, who beneath</l>
     <l n="838">The rosy wreath of pleasure and of love</l>
     <l n="839">Conceal the sickly and disgustful brow</l>
     <l n="840">Of riot and debauch, and often win</l>
     <l n="841">From weak unmanly princes the rich prize</l>
     <l n="842">To virtue due and wisdom, not to these</l>
     <l n="843">The cankers of a state; but least of all</l>
     <l n="844">Due to that traytor of his king and country,</l>
     <l n="845">Who lab'ring to build up the regal throne</l>
     <l n="846">Beyond its due proportion, and the strength</l>
     <l n="847">Of those foundations which the laws have laid,</l>
     <l n="848">O'erwhelms the people, and at once o'erturns</l>
     <l n="849">His royal master, places him at best</l>
     <l n="850">On an uneasy tott'ring pinnacle,</l>
     <l n="851">The mark of execration and reproach.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="60">
     <l n="852">These claims hast thou rejected; like a king</l>
     <l n="853">Discerning in mankind, and knowing well</l>
     <l n="854">The value of his favours: like a king</l>
     <l n="855">Deserving the high office of the judge</l>
     <l n="856">And arbiter of Europe: like a king</l>
     <l n="857">Equal to his great fame, and worth the care</l>
     <l n="858">Of those immortal spirits, who this day</l>
     <l n="859">Have quitted their celestial residence,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg n="61">
     <l n="861">But, Edward, be not thou amaz'd to find</l>

     <l n="864">O king! thou art beset with counterfeits</l>
     <l n="865">The very opposites to us, who seem</l>
     <l n="866">Far better than they are. For Flattery,</l>
     <l n="867">Cameleon-like, accommodates with care</l>
     <l n="868">To the court-hue his changeful countenance.</l>
     <l n="869">And when a prince is brave, magnanimous,</l>
     <l n="870">And high in spirit, then Ambition wears</l>
     <l n="871">A face of dignity, and nothing breathes</l>
     <l n="872">But lofty enterprizes, conquest, pow'r,</l>
     <l n="873">And schemes of glory to the sov'reign ear,</l>

     <l n="875">With more than duteous zeal. â Of these beware!</l>
     <l n="876">For as the Theban queen, in fables old,</l>
     <l n="877">Was, by the specious guile of fraudful Jove,</l>
     <l n="878">In her Amphitryon's form to guilt betray'd,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg n="62">
     <l n="888">Thus warn'd we leave thee, mighty prince: be firm,</l>

     <l n="890">Think it thy duty to revere thyself</l>
     <l n="891">The sacred laws of chivalry, the wise</l>
     <l n="892">Injunctions by thy order laid on all</l>
     <l n="893">The GARTER'D KNIGHTS; so shall thy fame remain</l>
     <l n="894">The great example of all future kings.</l>
     <l n="895">Farewell! for lo! the Genius of thy realm</l>
     <l n="896">With all his pomp attended, comes to share,</l>
     <l n="897">And grace the glories of this signal day.</l>
     <l n="898">These clouds of fragrance, that far-beaming blaze</l>
     <l n="899">Of heav'nly brightness, his approach declare.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="63">
     <l n="900">From the gay realms of cloudless day I come,</l>

     <l n="903">Float in the ocean of unbounded space;</l>
     <l n="904">On my invisible aÃ«rial throne</l>
     <l n="905">I sit, attended with a radiant band</l>
     <l n="906">Of spirits immortal, whose pure essences,</l>
     <l n="907">While clad in human shapes on earth they dwelt,</l>
     <l n="908">Thro' the dull clay of gross mortality</l>
     <l n="909">Disclos'd their heav'nly vigour, and burst forth</l>
     <l n="910">In godlike virtues and heroic deeds,</l>
     <l n="911">Their Albion gracing with as fair a growth</l>
     <l n="912">Of fame, as e'er enrich'd imperial Rome.</l>
     <l n="913">Thence ripe for heav'n and immortality,</l>
     <l n="914">To me, the Genius of this happy isle,</l>
     <l n="915">They fly, and claim the meed of their desert,</l>
     <l n="916">Celestial crowns, and ever-living praise</l>
     <l n="917">Recorded in the songs of heav'nly bards,</l>
     <l n="918">That round my throne their hymns of triumph sing,</l>
     <l n="919">Attuning to the sweet harmonious spheres</l>

    <lg n="64">
     <l n="921">Nor thus remov'd to heav'n, and thus employ'd</l>
     <l n="922">In careless raptures, wont they to forget</l>
     <l n="923">Their native country, and the public weal,</l>
     <l n="924">To which on earth their labours and their lives</l>
     <l n="925">They once devoted; but pursuing still</l>

     <l n="927">They watch the British empire, still intent</l>
     <l n="928">To check alternately th' incroaching waves</l>
     <l n="929">Of regal pow'r and popular liberty:</l>
     <l n="930">I, chief attentive near the royal throne,</l>
     <l n="931">Take up my watchful station, to infuse</l>
     <l n="932">My sage and mod'rate counsels in those ears,</l>
     <l n="933">Which wisdom hath prepar'd and purify'd</l>

     <l n="938">To manifest my presence; to declare,</l>
     <l n="939">Not in those whispers which have often spoke</l>
     <l n="940">Peace to thy conscious heart, but audibly</l>
     <l n="941">And evident to all, th' assent of heav'n</l>
     <l n="942">To the great business, which hath gather'd here</l>
