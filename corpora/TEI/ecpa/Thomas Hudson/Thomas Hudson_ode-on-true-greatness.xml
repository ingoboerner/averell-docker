    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">LET who will climb the towery steep</l>
     <l n="2">Of sovereignty, with slippery strides,</l>
     <l n="3">Where, on the bosom of the deep</l>
     <l n="4">Below, the pitchy pinnace rides:</l>
     <l n="5">A death's head flag, unfurl'd to view,</l>
     <l n="6">Waves ghastly; and a sable crew</l>
     <l n="7">Gaze from the deck, and seem to wait,</l>
     <l n="8">Dash'd down the pointed rocks, the rash unfortunate.</l>
     <l n="9">Mine be the low and level way,</l>
     <l n="10">Amid the quiet vale to stray,</l>
     <l n="11">Safe in some sylvan lodge to dwell,</l>
     <l n="12">And lull'd by the clear stream that speeds</l>
     <l n="13">By shallow fords to rustling reeds,</l>
     <l n="14">And small lakes, fring'd with homely aspodel.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="15">There sits the calm, the rural sage,</l>
     <l n="16">With nature's volume fair in view;</l>
     <l n="17">And meditates the shining page</l>
     <l n="18">Replete with wonders ever new:</l>
     <l n="19">While Wisdom points, on either hand,</l>
     <l n="20">Where plants, and herbs, and flowrets stand</l>
     <l n="21">In emerald groves, and shadowy glades,</l>
     <l n="22">In furzy moors, or musky-smelling meads.</l>
     <l n="23">Truth, in her liquid glass serene,</l>
     <l n="24">To him explains each moral scene:</l>
     <l n="25">Oft, in the downward skies, a train</l>
     <l n="26">Of tinsel insects he surveys,</l>
     <l n="27">Or glow-worm, with fallacious blaze,</l>
     <l n="28">Just emblem of court greatness, srail and vain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="29">Oft in his woodland walk he stops to mark</l>
     <l n="30">The spirited and youthful lark,</l>
     <l n="31">Warn'd by the dawning in the dappled east,</l>
     <l n="32">Lift his melodious flight thro' upper air;</l>
     <l n="33">Late the low tenant of the rushy nest</l>
     <l n="34">Now sings unrival'd in his radiant sphere.</l>
     <l n="35">The pondering hermit then sees Merit roam,</l>
     <l n="36">Above the nurslings of the courtly dome,</l>
     <l n="37">On Glory's sparkling wheels, rais'd from its humble dome.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="38">First of the families of fame,</l>
     <l n="39">That Rome's imperial city grace,</l>
     <l n="40">From rural huts and hamlets came</l>
     <l n="41">The Fabian and Fabrician race;</l>
     <l n="42">With that firm judge that could contemn</l>
     <l n="43">And banish the proud diadem.</l>
     <l n="44">To Sabine fields she owes the vine,</l>
     <l n="45">Whose tendrils yet round Virtue's column twine;</l>
     <l n="46">Which braves Oppression's wintry breath,</l>
     <l n="47">And stands the icy touch of Death.</l>
     <l n="48">The leafless flock, that Fortune dooms</l>
     <l n="49">To wither, with returning spring</l>
     <l n="50">(While the glad flocks of Freedom sing)</l>
     <l n="51">Profuse of promis'd sweets, with double vigour blooms.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="52">Hark! hark! 'tis Brutus' name I hear,</l>
     <l n="53">Join'd with his fair, heroic bride;</l>
     <l n="54">To Honour's hallow'd fane they steer</l>
     <l n="55">Along the favourable tide;</l>
     <l n="56">To her and Safety there to place</l>
     <l n="57">The tablet, vow'd to human race:</l>
     <l n="58">Blow, every kind and gentle gale</l>
     <l n="59">Of gratitude, and fan the swelling sail.</l>
     <l n="60">High on a fleecy couch reclin'd,</l>
     <l n="61">Of white and amber clouds combin'd,</l>
     <l n="62">Rome's genius lifts his august head;</l>
     <l n="63">Now slow descending nearer draws,</l>
     <l n="64">Hail'd with the popular applause,</l>
     <l n="65">And bids the solemn pageantry proceed.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="66">Go, the triumphal ornaments display;</l>
     <l n="67">Ye sacred Salii lead the way:</l>
     <l n="68">Next led the order of Patrician blood,</l>
     <l n="69">In awful march a numerous train compose,</l>
     <l n="70">And follow'd by the jubilating crowd;</l>
     <l n="71">As Cybel√© thro' Phrygian cities goes,</l>
     <l n="72">Majestic, and with golden turrets crown'd:</l>
     <l n="73">A hundred gods her gorgeous car surround,</l>
     <l n="74">A thousand tongues acclaim; the clanging cymbals sound.</l>
