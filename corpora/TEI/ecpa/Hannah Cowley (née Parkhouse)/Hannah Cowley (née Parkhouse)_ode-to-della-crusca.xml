     <l n="1">O THOU!</l>
     <l n="2">Who from ""</l>
     <l n="3">Canst stoop to where the low brook runs!</l>
     <l n="4">Thro' space with rapid comets glow; —</l>
     <l n="5">Or mark where, soft, the snow-drops grow!</l>
     <l n="6">O THOU!</l>
     <l n="7">Whose burning Pen now rapture paints!</l>
     <l n="8">Then moralizes, cold, with Saints!</l>
     <l n="9">Now trembling ardors can infuse —</l>
     <l n="10">Then, seems as dipp'd in cloister'd dews —</l>
     <l n="11">O say! thy BEING quick declare,</l>
     <l n="12">Art thou a Son of Earth, or Air?</l>
     <l n="13">Celestial Bard! though thy sweet song</l>
     <l n="14">Might to a Seraph's strains belong,</l>
     <l n="15">Its wondrous beauty, and its art</l>
     <l n="16">Can only  not  my heart.</l>
     <l n="17">So Heaven-sent light'ning  plays,</l>
     <l n="18">And wanton, throws its purple rays;</l>
     <l n="19">It leaps through Night's scarce pervious gloom,</l>
     <l n="20">Attracted by the Rose's bloom;</l>
     <l n="21">Th' illumin'd shrub then quiv'ring round,</l>
     <l n="22">It seems each scented bud to wound;</l>
     <l n="23">Morn shakes her locks, and see the Rose</l>
     <l n="24">In renovated beauty blows!</l>
     <l n="25">Smiles at the dart which past away,</l>
     <l n="26">And flings her perfume on the day.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="27">Thy light'ning Pen 'tis thus I greet,</l>
     <l n="28">Fearless its subtile point I meet;</l>
     <l n="29">Ne'er shall its spells my sad heart move,</l>
     <l n="30">From the calm state it vows to love.</l>
     <l n="31">All other bliss I've proved is vain —</l>
     <l n="32">All other bliss is dash'd with pain.</l>
     <l n="33">My waist with myrtles has been bound,</l>
     <l n="34">MY BROW WITH LAURELS HAS BEEN CROWN'D;</l>
     <l n="35">LOVE, has sigh'd hopeless at my feet,</l>
     <l n="36">LOVE, on my couch, has pour'd each sweet;</l>
     <l n="37">All these I've known, and now I fly</l>
     <l n="38">With thee, INDIFFERENCE, to die!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="39">Nor is thy gift ""</l>
     <l n="40">The Mind's quick powers that dost not freeze:</l>
     <l n="41">No! blest by  the soul expands,</l>
     <l n="42">And darts o'er fresh-created lands;</l>
     <l n="43">Springs from the confines of the earth</l>
     <l n="44">To where new systems struggle into birth;</l>
     <l n="45">The germ of future Worlds beholds,</l>
     <l n="46">The secrets of dark space unfolds;</l>
     <l n="47">Can watch how far the Erratic runs,</l>
     <l n="48">And gaze on DELLA CRUSCA's Suns;</l>
     <l n="49">In some new Orb can meet, ""</l>
     <l n="50">And him, on earth unknown, in Heaven with transport hail!</l>
