    <lg n="1" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="1">MIDST the proud fervor of the day,</l>
     <l n="2">Whilst the sun darts a torrid ray,</l>
     <l n="3">The humble daisey sinks its head,</l>
     <l n="4">And faints upon its lowly bed;</l>
     <l n="5">But when moist eve hath quench'd his fire,</l>
     <l n="6">And treads the fields in cool attire,</l>
     <l n="7">The daisy spreads again her bloom,</l>
     <l n="8">And offers up her mild perfume.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="9">Thus your resuscitating praise,</l>
     <l n="10">Breathed life upon my dying lays.</l>
     <l n="11">REYNOLDS ADMIRES! flatt'ry so sweet</l>
     <l n="12">With blushing vanity I meet,</l>
     <l n="13">But Bard polite! how hard the task</l>
     <l n="14">Which with such elegance you ask.</l>
     <l n="15">When DIDO bad ENEAS tell</l>
     <l n="16">The woes he knew to paint so well —</l>
     <l n="17">Did he not tell the queen, she tore</l>
     <l n="18">His closing wounds, and drew fresh gore,</l>
     <l n="19">From stabs that time had almost heal'd? —</l>
     <l n="20">Such, REUBEN, such, the thorn conceal'd,</l>
     <l n="21">Within your verses' flow'ry spell,</l>
     <l n="22">Which barb'rous! dares my pen compel.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="23">Yet how  the various god,</l>
     <l n="24">T'whom Proteus' self's a heavy clod?</l>
     <l n="25">Differing in each differing heart,</l>
     <l n="26">Scorning to play a constant part.</l>
     <l n="27">A tyger! — tyrant! — such is he,</l>
     <l n="28">Whom painted with  you see,</l>
     <l n="29">With downy wings, and childish face,</l>
     <l n="30">As though of the blest Cherub's race —</l>
     <l n="31">But oh! a serpent in disguise,</l>
     <l n="32">And as the lynx, his piercing eyes!</l>
     <l n="33">A raging fire, a deadly pain,</l>
     <l n="34">That gentlest heart-strings most will strain;</l>
     <l n="35">A fever, tempest, madness he —</l>
     <l n="36">Of all life's ills — A DREAD EPITOME!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="37">Ha! dost thou fear, and wilt thou run?</l>
     <l n="38">The little monster try to shun?</l>
     <l n="39">And wilt thou, REUBEN, too succeed —</l>
     <l n="40">And shall thy bosom never bleed;</l>
     <l n="41">Never his poison'd rankling dart</l>
     <l n="42">Quiver within thy tender heart?</l>
     <l n="43">Oh, hapless man! — oh, wretched fate!</l>
     <l n="44">Fly to Love's altar ere too late,</l>
     <l n="45">And deprecate the doom accurst,</l>
     <l n="46">Or bid that heart with sorrow burst.</l>
     <l n="47">Welcome the deadly fiery pain,</l>
     <l n="48">That gentlest heart-strings most will strain —</l>
     <l n="49">MADNESS IS HIS — but 'tis replete</l>
     <l n="50">With all that makes life's blessings sweet; —</l>
     <l n="51">A TYRANT he, but oh! his chains</l>
     <l n="52">Are richer than an empire's gains!</l>
     <l n="53">Sweet, the delirium which by love is spread,</l>
     <l n="54">Whate'er the paths his raptur'd vot'ries tread!</l>
     <l n="55">He paints the mist which hangs upon the eve,</l>
     <l n="56">With colours dearer than the Sun can give;</l>
     <l n="57">'Tis he who lends the nightingale its trills,</l>
     <l n="58">When her rich pipe the Empyrean fills,</l>
     <l n="59">Oh, 'tis the softness in his heart</l>
     <l n="60">Which makes the Lover in her song take part,</l>
     <l n="61">And faint upon each touching pause,</l>
     <l n="62">And lengthen out each added clause,</l>
     <l n="63">Till rapt attention, strain'd too high,</l>
     <l n="64">Rolls down its gushing tear, and breathes its gentle sigh.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="65">to Love is MORNING's hour,</l>
     <l n="66">When, from her chrystal roseate tower,</l>
     <l n="67">She sees the Goddess HEALTH pursue</l>
     <l n="68">The skimming breeze thro' fields of dew:</l>
     <l n="69">the flaming hour of noon,</l>
     <l n="70">When the sunk Linnet's fading tune,</l>
     <l n="71">Allures him to the beechy grove —</l>
     <l n="72">Or when some crag'd grotesque alcove</l>
     <l n="73">Sounds in his ear its tinkling rill,</l>
     <l n="74">And tempts him to its moss grown sill;</l>
     <l n="75">charm'd when on his tranced mind</l>
     <l n="76">Is wisper'd in the passing wind,</l>
     <l n="77">The name of her, whose name is bliss;</l>
     <l n="78">Or when he all unseen can kiss</l>
     <l n="79">The fringed bank where late she lay,</l>
     <l n="80">Hidden from th' imperious day.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="81">Oh, ye rapt glades, which glist'ring Luna decks,</l>
     <l n="82">Whose stretching shadows her refulgence checks!</l>
     <l n="83">Oh, ye soft floods, that hang upon the peak</l>
     <l n="84">Of lofty rocks, and bound in wanton freak,</l>
     <l n="85">Where thirsty meads your rushing streamlets crave,</l>
     <l n="86">And crowd their flowers around to drink your wave —</l>
     <l n="87">What are ye all, should Love withhold the dart,</l>
     <l n="88">Which wakes nice feelings in the torpid heart?</l>
     <l n="89">Where is the heart, that would such feelings fly,</l>
     <l n="90">Or fear th' inchanting, MAD'NING CUP to try?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="91">Must I speak  of love? the boundless theme</l>
     <l n="92">Might run beyond the edge of life's short dream:</l>
     <l n="93">His spells are blessings — witch'ries so sublime</l>
     <l n="94">They triumph o'er distress, and fate, and time.</l>
     <l n="95">Wouldst ask the  of love? — Oh! change the prayer,</l>
     <l n="96">Thou little know'st his power, to fasten there!</l>
     <l n="97">Let the mean bosom crave its</l>
     <l n="98">Thine shall with more distinguish'd ardors burn:</l>
     <l n="99">To  the passion — yes, be that thy strain,</l>
     <l n="100">Invoke the god of the mysterious pain!</l>
     <l n="101">Whate'er thy nature — gentle, fiery, rough —</l>
     <l n="102">To LOVE — learn but TO LOVE — and thou hast bliss enough!</l>
