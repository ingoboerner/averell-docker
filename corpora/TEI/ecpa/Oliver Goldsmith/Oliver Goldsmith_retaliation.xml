     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit:</l>
     <l n="39" met="-+|-+|-+|-+|-+|-+|-+" line_length="14">For a patriot too cool; for a drudge, disobedient,</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And too fond of the  to pursue the</l>

     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To eat mutton cold, and cut blocks with a razor.</l>

     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Here lies honest William, whose heart was a mint,</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">While the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't;</l>
     <l n="45" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The pupil of impulse, it forc'd him along,</l>
     <l n="46" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His conduct still right, with his argument wrong;</l>
     <l n="47" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Still aiming at honour, yet fearing to roam,</l>
     <l n="48" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The coachman was tipsy, the chariot drove home;</l>
     <l n="49" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Would you ask for his merits, alas! he had none,</l>
     <l n="50" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What was good was spontaneous, his faults were his own.</l>

     <l n="51" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Here lies honest Richard, whose fate I must sigh at,</l>
     <l n="52" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Alas, that such frolic should now be so quiet!</l>
     <l n="53" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What spirits were his, what wit and what whim,</l>
     <l n="54" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Now breaking a jest, and now breaking a limb;</l>
     <l n="55" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball,</l>
     <l n="56" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Now teazing and vexing, yet laughing at all?</l>
     <l n="57" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In short so provoking a devil was Dick,</l>
     <l n="58" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That we wish'd him full ten times a day at Old Nick.</l>

     <l n="63" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">A flattering painter, who made it his care</l>
     <l n="64" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are;</l>
     <l n="65" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His gallants are all faultless, his women divine,</l>
     <l n="66" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And comedy wonders at being so fine;</l>
     <l n="67" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out,</l>
     <l n="68" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Or rather like tragedy giving a rout.</l>

     <l n="70" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Of virtues and feelings, that folly grows proud,</l>
     <l n="71" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And coxcombs alike in their failings alone,</l>
     <l n="72" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Adopting his portraits are pleas'd with their own.</l>
     <l n="73" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Say, where has our poet this malady caught,</l>
     <l n="74" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Or wherefore his characters thus without fault?</l>
     <l n="75" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Say was it that vainly directing his view,</l>
     <l n="76" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To find out mens virtues and finding them few,</l>
     <l n="77" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf,</l>
     <l n="78" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He grew lazy at last and drew from himself?</l>

     <l n="80" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The scourge of impostors, the terror of quacks:</l>
     <l n="81" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Come all ye quack bards, and ye quacking divines,</l>
     <l n="82" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Come and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines,</l>
     <l n="83" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">When Satire and Censure encircled his throne,</l>
     <l n="84" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I fear'd for your safety, I fear'd for my own;</l>
     <l n="85" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But now he is gone, and we want a detector,</l>

     <l n="87" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Macpherson write bombast, and call it a style</l>
     <l n="88" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Our Townshend make speeches, and I shall compile;</l>
     <l n="89" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">New Lauders and Bowers the Tweed shall cross over,</l>
     <l n="90" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">No countryman living their tricks to discover;</l>
     <l n="91" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Detection her taper shall quench to a spark,</l>
     <l n="92" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And Scotchman meet Scotchman and cheat in the dark.</l>

     <l n="94" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man;</l>
     <l n="95" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">As an actor, confest without rival to shine,</l>
     <l n="96" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">As a wit, if not first, in the very first line;</l>
     <l n="97" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Yet with talents like these, and an excellent heart,</l>
     <l n="98" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The man had his failings, a dupe to his art;</l>
     <l n="99" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Like an ill-judging beauty, his colours he spread,</l>
     <l n="100" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And beplaister'd, with rouge, his own natural red.</l>
     <l n="101" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting,</l>
     <l n="102" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Twas only that, when he was off, he was acting:</l>
     <l n="103" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With no reason on earth to go out of his way,</l>

     <l n="105" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tho' secure of our hearts, yet confoundedly sick,</l>
     <l n="106" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">If they were not his own by finessing and trick;</l>
     <l n="107" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He cast off his friends, as a huntsman his pack,</l>
     <l n="108" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them back.</l>
     <l n="109" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow'd what came,</l>
     <l n="110" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And the puff of a dunce, he mistook it for fame;</l>
     <l n="111" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Till his relish grown callous, almost to disease,</l>

     <l n="113" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But let us be candid, and speak out our mind,</l>
     <l n="114" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind.</l>
     <l n="115" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys, and Woodfalls so grave,</l>
     <l n="116" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">What a commerce was yours, while you got and you gave?</l>
     <l n="117" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">How did Grub-street re-echo the shouts that you rais'd,</l>
     <l n="118" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">While he was beroscius'd, and you were beprais'd?</l>
     <l n="119" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But peace to his spirit, wherever it flies,</l>
     <l n="120" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To act as an angel, and mix with the skies:</l>
     <l n="121" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Those poets, who owe their best fame to his skill,</l>
     <l n="122" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Shall still be his flatterers, go where he will.</l>
     <l n="123" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Old Shakespeare, receive him, with praise and with love,</l>
     <l n="124" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above.</l>

     <l n="129" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser?</l>
     <l n="130" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I answer, no, no, for he always was wiser;</l>
     <l n="131" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Too courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat;</l>
     <l n="132" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His very worst foe can't accuse him of that.</l>
     <l n="133" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Perhaps he confided in men as they go,</l>

     <l n="139" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His pencil was striking, resistless and grand,</l>
     <l n="140" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His manners were gentle, complying and bland;</l>
     <l n="141" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Still born to improve us in every part,</l>
