     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">DEAR Nancy, since men have all made their own laws,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Which oppress the poor women, whatever's the cause;</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Since by hardness of reason or hardness of fist</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All wrong must be right if they choose to persist;</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">I'd have you with caution in wedlock engage,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For if once you are caught you're a bird in a cage,</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That may for dear liberty flutter the wing</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">As you hop round the perch, but 'tis chance if you sing.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The man who in courtship is studious to please,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Throws off his attention and hears not nor sees;</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Whilst her who before was the fairest of flowers</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The cloud on his brow ever drenches with showers:</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And the man whose rough manners were courteous before,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Gives you every reason to look for no more;</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For such churls I've seen through the whole of their lives</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Give nought but an oath or a frown to their wives.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Let her speech or her manners be e'er so bewitching,</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Why, women should only give mouth in the kitchen</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Nor e'en there rule the roast, for my lord must be by,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And a finger must always have in every pie.</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then he'd lifeless become, — to such silence is prone,</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That you'd think him a statue just cut out of stone;</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And his fair one, I'll wager, not all the year round</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Hears aught of his voice save a hum-and-ha sound.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Now some, to advise you all evils to shun,</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Bid you ever be happy by holding your tongue;</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But Jack Boaster has taught me that this will not do,</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">For when he is railing his dear shall rail too;</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And Andrew Macgrumble insists that his wife</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Shall ask pardon most humbly each hour of her life:</l>
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And he's right; for, since wedlock has made them both one,</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis fit for such sin she should daily atone!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then there's trim little Dicky, who calls himself bless'd</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In a spouse so accomplish'd, so young, and well dress'd;</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Should she play with her lap-dog, 'twould give him such pain,</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">He would tear down a curl, and then curl it again;</l>
     <l n="37" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Should you travel life's road with a mate such as these,</l>
     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Tis a chance the whole journey you'd do aught to please.</l>
     <l n="39" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Yet you fondly fancy that yours is a swain</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Whom softness and sweetness will still keep the same; —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="41" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That when years have roll'd on, though your locks be turn'd grey;</l>
     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Though the rosebud is blown — nay, quite faded away;</l>
     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tho' the canker of time should love's blossoms destroy,</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Yet as Darby and Joan you may still be wish'd joy; —</l>
     <l n="45" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then hold your good humour, for that is the charm</l>
     <l n="46" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Which can make beauty linger, and keep the heart warm;</l>
     <l n="47" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And, when youth, with light wings, shall for ever have flown,</l>
     <l n="48" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Make your Darby delighted to sit by his Joan!</l>
