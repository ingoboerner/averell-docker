     <l n="1" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">MANY are the mournful stories</l>
     <l n="2" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Which the page of love unfolds;</l>
     <l n="3" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Many are the piercing sorrows</l>
     <l n="4" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Which that faithful record holds.</l>
     <l n="5" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Love, that jewel of our nature,</l>
     <l n="6" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Parents oft have sought to buy;</l>
     <l n="7" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">But 'tis merit makes the purchase,</l>
     <l n="8" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Or 'tis fancy casts the die.</l>
     <l n="9" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">'Tis not wealth, nor sordid riches,</l>
     <l n="10" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">That are treasures of the mind;</l>
     <l n="11" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">No; — 'tis surely sweet contentment</l>
     <l n="12" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Which in humble breasts we find.</l>
     <l n="13" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Think not, parents, that your children</l>
     <l n="14" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Can your sober plans pursue,</l>
     <l n="15" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Or your influence bind their natures</l>
     <l n="16" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">E'er to think or act like you.</l>
     <l n="17" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Fifty years have render'd callous</l>
     <l n="18" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Those affections which you blame;</l>
     <l n="19" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">But let Memory be recorder,</l>
     <l n="20" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And you'll find yours once the same.</l>
     <l n="21" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">If at twenty hearts were harden'd,</l>
     <l n="22" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And could every feeling brave;</l>
     <l n="23" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">What would be their rigid natures</l>
     <l n="24" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Ere they dropp'd into the grave!</l>
     <l n="25" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Once within this happy island</l>
     <l n="26" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Liv'd a knight of mighty fame;</l>
     <l n="27" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Birth, and wealth, and growing greatness,</l>
     <l n="28" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">From the world acquire a name.</l>
     <l n="29" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Pride had mix'd with every honour,</l>
     <l n="30" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And ambition steel'd his breast;</l>
     <l n="31" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Nor did there e'er one soft emotion</l>
     <l n="32" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Make atonement for the rest.</l>
     <l n="33" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Yet the wise and gracious Donor</l>
     <l n="34" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Had one counter-gift bestow'd;</l>
     <l n="35" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And, to lead his soul to mercy,</l>
     <l n="36" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Sweet Alicia points the road.</l>
     <l n="37" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Youth conjoin'd with all the Graces</l>
     <l n="38" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Taught the maiden how to move,</l>
     <l n="39" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And in every beauteous feature</l>
     <l n="40" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Beam'd benevolence and love.</l>
     <l n="41" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Flora, as she cross'd her garden,</l>
     <l n="42" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Twin'd the lily with the rose;</l>
     <l n="43" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And, when passing sweet Alicia,</l>
     <l n="44" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">On her head the gift bestows.</l>
     <l n="45" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Form'd by virtue and by nature</l>
     <l n="46" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">For the solace of some heart,</l>
     <l n="47" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Many a youth with noble fervour</l>
     <l n="48" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Sought in her's to gain a part.</l>
     <l n="49" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Merit only caught the maiden,</l>
     <l n="50" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Merit made one youth belov'd; —</l>
     <l n="51" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Edwin durst not hope for favour,</l>
     <l n="52" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Yet 'twas Edwin she approv'd.</l>
     <l n="53" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Birth nor riches gild his title,</l>
     <l n="54" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Simple worth is all his claim;</l>
     <l n="55" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Yet she thinks that fair escutcheon</l>
     <l n="56" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Brightest in heraldic fame.</l>
     <l n="57" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">But, alas! the world's opinion</l>
     <l n="58" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Will not sanctify the thought;</l>
     <l n="59" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Nor, Alicia, will thy father</l>
     <l n="60" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Value merit as it ought.</l>
     <l n="61" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Long was seen the lovely maiden</l>
     <l n="62" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">In dejection slowly move!</l>
     <l n="63" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Smiles forsook their former mansion</l>
     <l n="64" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And she fear'd the cause was love.</l>
     <l n="65" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">This the angry father told her,</l>
     <l n="66" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And as he told he scorn'd her woes;</l>
     <l n="67" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">To her child, blanch'd with emotion,</l>
     <l n="68" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">The unhappy mother goes.</l>
     <l n="69" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">"Ah, my love, have you deceiv'd me!</l>
     <l n="70" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Why not trust this feeling breast?</l>
     <l n="71" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Sure thou knowest I'd die to save thee,</l>
     <l n="72" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Die to lull thy woes to rest."</l>
     <l n="73" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">"Yes; too well I know your goodness,</l>
     <l n="74" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Gratitude now swells this heart;</l>
     <l n="75" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And when forc'd to pierce that bosom,</l>
     <l n="76" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Think but how my own must smart.</l>
     <l n="77" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Your inquiring looks have ask'd me</l>
     <l n="78" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Often — why the smother'd sigh?</l>
     <l n="79" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And your nice discernment told you</l>
     <l n="80" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Every cause and reason why.</l>
     <l n="81" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Often have you seen my sorrow,</l>
     <l n="82" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Seen the anguish of my soul;</l>
     <l n="83" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Edwin — but I need not tell you, —</l>
     <l n="84" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Edwin does this heart controul!"</l>
     <l n="85" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">The gallant ship her wings unfurls,</l>
     <l n="86" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And speeds before the favouring wind;</l>
     <l n="87" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Edwin from his lov'd retreats</l>
     <l n="88" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Reluctant hies to burning Ind.</l>
     <l n="89" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">'Tis not change of place nor climate</l>
     <l n="90" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Can a rooted sorrow move;</l>
     <l n="91" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Neither is the power of absence</l>
     <l n="92" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Equal to the charm of love.</l>
     <l n="93" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Edwin found this truth, and, drooping,</l>
     <l n="94" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">On the Ganges' banks reclin'd;</l>
     <l n="95" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Sultry suns seem'd in conjunction</l>
     <l n="96" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">With the fever of his mind.</l>
     <l n="97" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Sad despair, and cruel absence,</l>
     <l n="98" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Swift the vital thread had worn;</l>
     <l n="99" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And upon his funeral bier</l>
     <l n="100" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Hapless Edwin soon was borne.</l>
     <l n="101" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Equal grief by slower movements</l>
     <l n="102" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Brought Alicia to the tomb;</l>
     <l n="103" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Deep disease by secret workings</l>
     <l n="104" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Undermin'd her youthful bloom.</l>
     <l n="105" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Absence all her comforts wasted,</l>
     <l n="106" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">All her joys with Edwin flew;</l>
     <l n="107" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Though each day her glowing fancy</l>
     <l n="108" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Brought her Edwin to her view.</l>
     <l n="109" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">O'er her father's rigid nature</l>
     <l n="110" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Dying sorrows now prevail; —</l>
     <l n="111" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">"Live Alicia, live my daughter!</l>
     <l n="112" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Nor on me thy woes entail.</l>
     <l n="113" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">My pride and hate I've now discarded;</l>
     <l n="114" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Edwin's merit claims thy hand;</l>
     <l n="115" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Soon, soon may propitious breezes</l>
     <l n="116" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Waft him to his native land!"</l>
     <l n="117" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Joy illum'd its former mansion,</l>
     <l n="118" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Alicia's eye again was bright;</l>
     <l n="119" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Hope shone forth in rays of gladness,</l>
     <l n="120" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And her soul was all delight.</l>
     <l n="121" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">But ah, how short our gleams of pleasure!</l>
     <l n="122" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Sorrow only seems to last;</l>
     <l n="123" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Joys, like arrows, swiftly flying,</l>
     <l n="124" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Scarce are seen ere they are past.</l>
     <l n="125" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Alicia heard her Edwin's story,</l>
     <l n="126" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Then sweet hope for ever fled;</l>
     <l n="127" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Every look declar'd her dying,</l>
     <l n="128" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And how much she wish'd her dead.</l>
     <l n="129" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Soon her wishes were accomplish'd,</l>
     <l n="130" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Soon she breath'd her latest breath;</l>
     <l n="131" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And her parents mourn'd, heartbroken,</l>
     <l n="132" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Their dear Alicia till their death.</l>
     <l n="133" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Yearly shall the village maidens</l>
     <l n="134" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Visit poor Alicia's tomb,</l>
     <l n="135" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">And, as they list her simple story,</l>
     <l n="136" met="+-|+-|+-|+-" line_length="8">Strew fresh flowers of fairest bloom.</l>
