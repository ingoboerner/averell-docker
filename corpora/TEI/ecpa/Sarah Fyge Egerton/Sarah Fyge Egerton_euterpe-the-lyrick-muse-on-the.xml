     <l n="1">, sweetest of the ,</l>
     <l n="2">The most Inspiring, and the most Divine,</l>
     <l n="3">By my own Lyre rais'd to extatick Joy</l>
     <l n="4">Full of kind Influence expecting sate,</l>
     <l n="5">When tuneful  would my Aid implore,</l>
     <l n="6">Who with gay Transports did my Gifts employ,</l>
     <l n="7">And meanest Thoughts above my Notes did soar</l>
     <l n="8">But strait a dismal, and unwelcome Sound,</l>
     <l n="9">Fill'd all th' Ã†thereal Courts around,</l>
     <l n="10">Dryden .</l>
     <l n="11">But like the common things in mortal State,</l>
     <l n="12">Lost in th' impartial Gulf of an inevitable Fate,</l>
     <l n="13">At the dread News Grief all my Lustre veil'd,</l>
     <l n="14">I broke my harmonious  and ,</l>
     <l n="15">Threw by my softning ever-charming Flute,</l>
     <l n="16">Not the least glympse of Joy appears,</l>
     <l n="17">No radiant Nymphs about my Pallace wait,</l>
     <l n="18">Nor drink I any  but my Tears.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="19">I with profoundest Cause, and Sorrow mourn,</l>
     <l n="20">Over my  sacred Urn:</l>
     <l n="21">He was my greatest Glory, only boast,</l>
     <l n="22">Through him I let ungrateful Mankind know,</l>
     <l n="23">What mighty Wonders I could do,</l>
     <l n="24">But now, like him, to the inferior World I'm lost.</l>
     <l n="25">I taught Him all the softer Airs of Love,</l>
     <l n="26">And Anthems so divine; he'll find the same above.</l>
     <l n="27">With an auspicious Pride I did dispense</l>
     <l n="28">My mighty Favours, when  did implore,</l>
     <l n="29">From my pregnant unexhausted Store,</l>
     <l n="30">Of tuneful Fancies, and harmonious Sense.</l>
     <l n="31">When I with gentle Fire have warm'd the Breast,</l>
     <l n="32">The Soul with pleasing Raptures bles't,</l>
     <l n="33">The sacred Flame in ev'ry part does shine.</l>
     <l n="34">The , like the , is all divine,</l>
     <l n="35">Poetry's not th' effect of Art, or Wine, or Love,</l>
     <l n="36">Tho'  sometimes the Gift improve,</l>
     <l n="37">Nor is the warmth that Poets Breasts inspire,</l>
     <l n="38">, but Celestial Fire.</l>
     <l n="39">A God-like Ray enlightning from above;</l>
     <l n="40">As decent Measures, regular Motions be</l>
     <l n="41">Through all the tuneful Universe,</l>
     <l n="42">And speak in all a glorious Harmony,</l>
     <l n="43">Ev'n so the mystick Numbers of melodious Verse,</l>
     <l n="44">Are of th' intellectual World the sacred Symmetry.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="45">I chose of all the tuneful Throng,</l>
     <l n="46">His Soul with Ardour fill'd fit for immortal Song;</l>
     <l n="47">Learn'd him all Lyrick Arts of Poetry,</l>
     <l n="48">Such as might with Celestial Notes agree;</l>
     <l n="49">Which his Industry did improve,</l>
     <l n="50">In Celebrations, Elegies and Love,</l>
     <l n="51">And ev'ry Theme which his commanding Pen would try</l>
     <l n="52">With strength of Judgment, and profoundest Sense,</l>
     <l n="53">With sparkling Wit, gay Fancy, Eloquence,</l>
     <l n="54">His Verse did all abound:</l>
     <l n="55">In him alone was found</l>
     <l n="56">The much desir'd, aim'd at Excellence.</l>
     <l n="57">In ev'ry Line magnificent or sweet,</l>
     <l n="58">Like , or else like .</l>
     <l n="59">magnetick Harp less Pow'r cou'd boast,</l>
     <l n="60">All , unless in  when e'er he sung was .</l>
     <l n="61">Above 'em all he rais'd his matchless Lays,</l>
     <l n="62">Glory of , and Wits Empire too,</l>
     <l n="63">Which tho' the Subjects are but Few,</l>
     <l n="64">Did justly wreath him with deserved Bays:</l>
     <l n="65">The verdant Diadem which Laureats Crown,</l>
     <l n="66">Ne'er look'd so fresh as when he put it on,</l>
     <l n="67">Then like his Lines with Godlike-lustre shone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="68">With a Superior and victorious Grace</l>
     <l n="69">The sacred Place,</l>
     <l n="70">He did almost unenvy'd assume,</l>
     <l n="71">I, pleas'd to see the Branches spread</l>
     <l n="72">O're his triumphant Head,</l>
     <l n="73">From th'  Spring</l>
     <l n="74">Did Water bring,</l>
     <l n="75">Sprinkled them oft that they might ever bloom.</l>
     <l n="76">But, oh! they cou'd not stand the Rage,</l>
     <l n="77">Of an ill-natur'd and Lethargick Age,</l>
     <l n="78">Who spight of  wou'd  be Wise,</l>
     <l n="79">All noble Raptures, Extasies despise,</l>
     <l n="80">And only Plodders after Sense will Prize.</l>
     <l n="81">They from his meritorious Brow</l>
     <l n="82">Th' exalted Laurel tear,</l>
     <l n="83">Which none but he could justly wear,</l>
     <l n="84">And He must suffer  too.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="85">With Him they did suppress all lofty flights of Poetry.</l>
     <l n="86">All melting Airs, and rapt'ring Harmony,</l>
     <l n="87">But this Revenge, let Mankind take from me.</l>
     <l n="88">If any dare on  Death to Write,</l>
     <l n="89">Not to express their Grief, but shew their Wit,</l>
     <l n="90">I the ambitious Purpose will Reverse,</l>
     <l n="91">Deny my Aid,</l>
     <l n="92">And so shall each inspiring Maid.</l>
     <l n="93">Resolving ungrateful Man that could contemn</l>
     <l n="94">Such noble Excellence in Him.</l>
     <l n="95">Shall never more the Blessing know,</l>
     <l n="96">We'll ne'r again our Influence bestow.</l>
     <l n="97">Tho' 'tis pretended to adorn his Herse.</l>
     <l n="98">(Unless the generous  implore,</l>
     <l n="99">Then in him shall all our Glories shine as heretofore.)</l>
     <l n="100">But to express our own immortal Love,</l>
     <l n="101">We'll Solemnize Great  Obsequies above,</l>
     <l n="102">Our Grief such Emphasis shall bear,</l>
     <l n="103">As no Corporeal Organs can declare,</l>
     <l n="104">And one Eternal Sigh spread thro' the Extended Air.</l>
