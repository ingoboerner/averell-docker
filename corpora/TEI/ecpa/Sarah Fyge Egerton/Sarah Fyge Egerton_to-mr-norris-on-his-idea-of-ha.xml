    <lg n="1" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="1">Pythagorick notions would agree,</l>
     <l n="2">With sublimated Christianity;</l>
     <l n="3">What mighty Soul, shall I allow,</l>
     <l n="4">Informs thy Body now;</l>
     <l n="5">For when did such appear,</l>
     <l n="6">Sure the belov'd Disciple's Soul is here.</l>
     <l n="7">Not us'd since then, but kept above,</l>
     <l n="8">And taught a more extatick Love;</l>
     <l n="9">The Understanding more inlarg'd and free,</l>
     <l n="10">Each generous Faculty</l>
     <l n="11">Refin'd, Improv'd, made more compleat,</l>
     <l n="12">In the seraphick Seat.</l>
     <l n="13">The brightest warmest of th' exalted Quire,</l>
     <l n="14">Flaming with Rays of beatifick Fire;</l>
     <l n="15">Such seems thy elevated Soul to be,</l>
     <l n="16">And not the usual sort gave to Mortality.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="17">The great, the Eternal God of Love,</l>
     <l n="18">Took Pity on us from above;</l>
     <l n="19">He could no longer see,</l>
     <l n="20">Our Souls wrapt in Obscurity:</l>
     <l n="21">But sent thee like, a bright celestial Ray,</l>
     <l n="22">To clear our Sight, and to direct the Way;</l>
     <l n="23">To the Etherial Courts of Bliss,</l>
     <l n="24">The only great, and lasting Happiness.</l>
     <l n="25">The active native Principle of Love,</l>
     <l n="26">We found did move</l>
     <l n="27">By an internal Influence,</l>
     <l n="28">But 'twas toward some object of the Sense:</l>
     <l n="29">Effects and Causes were not understood,</l>
     <l n="30">We only knew we wisht for Good,</l>
     <l n="31">And would with Joy each glimpse pursue,</l>
     <l n="32">Resolve to fasten there, and think 'twas true.</l>
     <l n="33">In vain we thought our Love was fixt,</l>
     <l n="34">For all those Joys were intermixt</l>
     <l n="35">With Disappointments and Deceit,</l>
     <l n="36">Our strugling Souls themselves did cheat:</l>
     <l n="37">Still they desir'd and lov'd, but were not blest,</l>
     <l n="38">Nor found they Rest,</l>
     <l n="39">Till thy bright Pen markt out the happy Prize,</l>
     <l n="40">Taught us at once to love and to be wise.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="41">Thou dost disect our weak distemper'd Soul,</l>
     <l n="42">Discover'st the Disease and mak'st us whole;</l>
     <l n="43">Prescrib'st such Methods, which if we obey,</l>
     <l n="44">We shall no longer doat on Clay,</l>
     <l n="45">Which long our vitiated Souls have fed,</l>
     <l n="46">But shall have Appetite to Celestial Bread.</l>
     <l n="47">We shall no longer fondly play,</l>
     <l n="48">With Trifles on the way,</l>
     <l n="49">But climb the Hill with a delightful hast,</l>
     <l n="50">And feast our Souls at thy divine Repast.</l>
     <l n="51">But lest, like doubtful or unthankful Guest,</l>
     <l n="52">We should neglect the Royal Feast;</l>
     <l n="53">Thou, to incourage our appearance there,</l>
     <l n="54">Hast kindly given us a Bill of Fare.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="55">By powerful Energy of Thoughts divine,</l>
     <l n="56">Thou didst thy Soul raise and refine,</l>
     <l n="57">With strong Impulse it did upward move,</l>
     <l n="58">Mounting on eager Wings of Love;</l>
     <l n="59">Through all th' inferior Courts it made its way,</l>
     <l n="60">To the bright Spring of everlasting day;</l>
     <l n="61">Did all the amazing Glories see,</l>
     <l n="62">And what it shou'd hereafter be,</l>
     <l n="63">Saluted by the soft Seraphick Quire,</l>
     <l n="64">Who's Anthems all its Faculties inspire,</l>
     <l n="65">But flasht to mighty Rays of sacred Fire.</l>
     <l n="66">For the refulgent Glories were too great,</l>
     <l n="67">It could not bear such Raptures yet,</l>
     <l n="68">Till Immortality had made it more compleat:</l>
     <l n="69">It could no longer stay, no longer view,</l>
     <l n="70">Then down again it flew,</l>
     <l n="71">Did with Angelick Radiance shine,</l>
     <l n="72">Inspir'd with Sapience divine.</l>
     <l n="73">It doth its bright Etherial Voyage tell,</l>
     <l n="74">And in what Bliss departed Souls do dwell:</l>
     <l n="75">All this in pure and pregnant Elegance we hear,</l>
     <l n="76">Plain as Corporeal Organs can declare,</l>
     <l n="77">That when we read thy Lines we almost think we're there.</l>
