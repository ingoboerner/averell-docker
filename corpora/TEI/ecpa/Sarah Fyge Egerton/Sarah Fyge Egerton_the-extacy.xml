    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">, Mount, my Soul on high,</l>
     <l n="2">Cut thro' the spacious Sky;</l>
     <l n="3">Scale the great Mountainous heaps that be,</l>
     <l n="4">Betwixt the upper World, and thee.</l>
     <l n="5">Stop not, till thou the utmost Region know,</l>
     <l n="6">Leave all the Glittering Worlds below:</l>
     <l n="7">Then take thy Noble flight,</l>
     <l n="8">Into the sacred Magazine of Light,</l>
     <l n="9">View the bright, the Empyrean Throne</l>
     <l n="10">Of the great, the Almighty ONE.</l>
     <l n="11">All the Miriades of shining Hosts survey,</l>
     <l n="12">With the seraphick blazing Throng;</l>
     <l n="13">Celebrating their Eternal Day,</l>
     <l n="14">With an Eternal Song.</l>
     <l n="15">In vain my dazled Soul would gaze around,</l>
     <l n="16">(The beatifick Glorys so confound)</l>
     <l n="17">It must be quite disrob'd, e'er tread this Holy Ground.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="18">Descend you daring Spirit, think 'tis fair,</l>
     <l n="19">If thou may'st traverse the inferior Air,</l>
     <l n="20">Content with humbler Curiosities,</l>
     <l n="21">View the expanded the Skies,</l>
     <l n="22">With radient Worlds, 'tis richly deck'd,</l>
     <l n="23">By the Almighty Architect.</l>
     <l n="24">Mount  Wain,</l>
     <l n="25">Drive over all the Ã†therial Plain,</l>
     <l n="26">And to augment thy Speed,</l>
     <l n="27">With blazing Comets lash the Restive Steeds.</l>
     <l n="28">Make them neigh aloud and Foam,</l>
     <l n="29">Till all the Sky a Milky way become;</l>
     <l n="30">What tho' they Fret and Rage,</l>
     <l n="31">To pass their wonted Stage.</l>
     <l n="32">Make them Praunce o'er all the amazing Place,</l>
     <l n="33">Quite to the empty Space,</l>
     <l n="34">And as ye go, see what Inhabitants there are,</l>
     <l n="35">In every World, of every Star;</l>
     <l n="36">Their Shape, their Manners and their State,</l>
     <l n="37">Write in Journals as ye go,</l>
     <l n="38">And to the inquiring Earth relate;</l>
     <l n="39">By dropping it below.</l>
     <l n="40">When weary'd with your universal round,</l>
     <l n="41">Let the Sphears harmonious sound,</l>
     <l n="42">Refresh and Charm your Spirits, till they be</l>
     <l n="43">Fit to fly back to their first ventur'd one Immensity</l>
     <l n="44">But oh! the Harmony's too soft, too sweet,</l>
     <l n="45">The Eternal strains too ravishingly great,</l>
     <l n="46">I cannot bear such Transports yet,</l>
     <l n="47">Well then, I'll leave these mighty heights and go</l>
     <l n="48">And over-look the little Globe below.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="49">In this Amphibious Ball, is vast variety,</l>
     <l n="50">To entertain my Curiosity:</l>
     <l n="51">Here the great Waters of the mighty deep,</l>
     <l n="52">Their fixt amazing Bounds do keep;</l>
     <l n="53">In vain they Rage and Roar,</l>
     <l n="54">But dare not touch on the restraining Shoar.</l>
     <l n="55">Here finny Herds of th' smallest sort,</l>
     <l n="56">Safely Play and Sport;</l>
     <l n="57">Wanton I'th' Flood, with no more Danger then</l>
     <l n="58">The Pastimes of Leviathan.</l>
     <l n="59">Here does in Triumph ride,</l>
     <l n="60">The stately Trophies of  Pride:</l>
     <l n="61">Her Ships which to the  Trade,</l>
     <l n="62">Such Noble Fabricks are made;</l>
     <l n="63">And so numerous appear,</l>
     <l n="64">The frighted Natives do our Traffick fear,</l>
     <l n="65">And doubt we will invade.</l>
     <l n="66">Securely too in these,</l>
     <l n="67">They visit the Antipodes.</l>
     <l n="68">From  they, the courteous Race begun,</l>
     <l n="69">A piece of complaisance unknown,</l>
     <l n="70">To all but civil , and the obliging Sun.</l>
     <l n="71">with pompous Pride does bear</l>
     <l n="72">Those glorious Terrors; Ships of War.</l>
     <l n="73">The floating Towr's they in  draw;</l>
     <l n="74">Keep all the circling Realms in awe.</l>
     <l n="75">Yet these vast Bodies, the soft Waters bear:</l>
     <l n="76">So the great Bird of , mounts in the trackless Air.</l>
     <l n="77">On the smooth Floods, the swelling Billows rise,</l>
     <l n="78">As if the liquid Mountains touch'd the Skies:</l>
     <l n="79">Then quick they plunged, with an Impetuous hast,</l>
     <l n="80">And seem'd to speak Destruction as they pass'd,</l>
     <l n="81">Yet Arm'd with Avarice and Curiosities,</l>
     <l n="82">Men scorn the Dangers, of the threatning Seas.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="83">Next on the solid Parts, I cast my Eye,</l>
     <l n="84">Did vast scorcht Desarts spie;</l>
     <l n="85">Which untamed Beasts, and Monsters bred,</l>
     <l n="86">By them alone inhabited,</l>
     <l n="87">I saw huge Mountains of uncommon Earth,</l>
     <l n="88">Some belcht with Terror forth;</l>
     <l n="89">A sulpherous Smoak,</l>
     <l n="90">Loud as amazing Thunder spoke,</l>
     <l n="91">From the unexhausted Bowels came,</l>
     <l n="92">Ashes and Stones, evacuated by Flame;</l>
     <l n="93">Remote from these are frigid Mountains too;</l>
     <l n="94">Thick cloth'd in fleecy Snow.</l>
     <l n="95">Some by restringent Air congeal'd as hard,</l>
     <l n="96">As if with Adamantine barr'd:</l>
     <l n="97">Stupendious Rocks of hideous Stones I found,</l>
     <l n="98">Whose dangerous Heads, lean'd o're the threaten'd Ground.</l>
     <l n="99">Deep in Earths center, far from human sight,</l>
     <l n="100">I search'd with intellectual Light;</l>
     <l n="101">(Pierc'd to the gloomy Ray,</l>
     <l n="102">Where subterrenean Fires, in silence play,</l>
     <l n="103">Like the faint Glimps of an imprison'd Day.)</l>
     <l n="104">Where unmolested Streams with gentle force,</l>
     <l n="105">Press, to their Primeveal source;</l>
     <l n="106">And sometimes upward, gush thro' poreous Earth,</l>
     <l n="107">Give to the healing Baths, a useful Birth;)</l>
     <l n="108">In its more wealthy parts, the Minerals lay,</l>
     <l n="109">And ponderous Mettals, shining Nerves display:</l>
     <l n="110">In her bright Bowels, radient Gems remains,</l>
     <l n="111">Till cruel Man dissects, and rends her Saphir vains.</l>
     <l n="112">With Grief and Wonder I behold,</l>
     <l n="113">The Noble, but mischevious Gold;</l>
     <l n="114">Oh! with what Toil, and mighty Pain,</l>
     <l n="115">Men the inchanting Mettle gain.</l>
     <l n="116">This Tyrant Clay Lords it o'er human kind,</l>
     <l n="117">Tho' they themselves in dirt, at first the Monarch find;</l>
     <l n="118">Lets their Stupidity, no more upbraid,</l>
     <l n="119">Who worshipp'd Gods, which their own Hands had made,</l>
     <l n="120">Since we're by Gold to greater Crimes betray'd.</l>
     <l n="121">Our Country, Faith, Friends, Honour for its sold,</l>
     <l n="122">Nay, Heaven and Love, is sacrafic'd to Gold;</l>
     <l n="123">We're worse Idolaters, than they,</l>
     <l n="124">Who only Homage gave; since we mischeviously obey.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="125">Then the habitable World appear'd,</l>
     <l n="126">By Art, vast Towns and pompous Temples fear'd</l>
     <l n="127">The pleasing Fields, awhile detain'd my sight</l>
     <l n="128">With a serene delight:</l>
     <l n="129">The flowry Meads, with various Colours dy'd,</l>
     <l n="130">And smiling Nature, in her verdant Pride;</l>
     <l n="131">Here ancient Woods, and blooming Groves,</l>
     <l n="132">(Fit recesses, for celestial Loves,)</l>
     <l n="133">Where purling Streams, glide with delightful hast,</l>
     <l n="134">On whose cool Banks, are spreading Willows plac'd:</l>
     <l n="135">The chearful Birds sing on the shading Bough,</l>
     <l n="136">In such glad Notes, as Nature did bestow.</l>
     <l n="137">The bleating Flocks and Herds, o'erspread the Plains,</l>
     <l n="138">And recompence the joyful Peasants pains.</l>
     <l n="139">Here the unenvy'd Village stood,</l>
     <l n="140">Rais'd of native Clay, and neighbouring Wood.</l>
     <l n="141">The Inhabitants as void of Pride, or Art,</l>
     <l n="142">Blest with plain Diet, and an honest Heart;</l>
     <l n="143">These Plow'd the Ground, and Sow'd the pregnant Grain,</l>
     <l n="144">Reap'd joyfully; the plentious Crop again:</l>
     <l n="145">Innocent Slaves, to whose rude Care we owe,</l>
     <l n="146">The chief supports of Life, and utmost needs below.</l>
     <l n="147">Remoter helps are Springs to Luxury,</l>
     <l n="148">Rich Wines and Spices, and the Tyrian die,</l>
     <l n="149">Do not our Wants, but Wantonness supply.</l>
     <l n="150">Here in his humble Cott, the Rustick lies,</l>
     <l n="151">Knows not the Curse, of being Great or Wise;</l>
     <l n="152">Ambition, Treachery, and Fear,</l>
     <l n="153">Are Strangers here.</l>
     <l n="154">Secure and quiet they go plodding on,</l>
     <l n="155">Happy, because too mean to be undone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="156">Then I espy'd from far,</l>
     <l n="157">Troops of shining Men, ingag'd in War,</l>
     <l n="158">Their artful Weapons, are with Rage imploy'd,</l>
     <l n="159">And Man, by Man, is Savagely destroy'd:</l>
     <l n="160">Poor mercenary Slaves they die,</l>
     <l n="161">But seldom know for why;</l>
     <l n="162">Oh! what Confusions here I cannot bear,</l>
     <l n="163">These horrid Groans that reach my distant Ear</l>
     <l n="164">From slaugher'd heaps, of dying Accents there.</l>
     <l n="165">Sometimes wast Towns in Flames appear,</l>
     <l n="166">Huge Castles mount, and shatter in the Air,</l>
     <l n="167">But ah! what pity 'tis,</l>
     <l n="168">Mankind should Glory in such Arts as these;</l>
     <l n="169">Then to the populous Cities, I repair'd,</l>
     <l n="170">Found they were little less insnar'd;</l>
     <l n="171">Tho' not Alarm'd with mighty noise of Wars,</l>
     <l n="172">Yet curs'd with grating, private Jars,</l>
     <l n="173">Envy and Strife, Self-Interest, and Deceits,</l>
     <l n="174">Extravagance and Noise, her Fate compleats.</l>
     <l n="175">Then I survey'd the splendid Court,</l>
     <l n="176">Found pageant Follies, Revelling and Sport,</l>
     <l n="177">Base Falshood, Lust, Ambition, Emnity,</l>
     <l n="178">Soft wanton Intervals, and Luxury,</l>
     <l n="179">Destructive Flattery, and hateful Pride,</l>
     <l n="180">And all the City Sins beside.</l>
     <l n="181">Thinks I, what shall I do,</l>
     <l n="182">If I must live again below,</l>
     <l n="183">For I remember'd that I had been there,</l>
     <l n="184">And a return to Earth, did fear.</l>
     <l n="185">Grant ye bless'd Powers, said I,</l>
     <l n="186">If I must downwards fly;</l>
     <l n="187">I may Descend upon the blooming Plain,</l>
     <l n="188">Bless'd with the harmless Nymph, and humble Swain,</l>
     <l n="189">There let me ever undisturb'd remain.</l>
