    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">when  at a Monarch's death,</l>
     <l n="2">(Which seems Prophan'd by Sighs from vulgar Breath;)</l>
     <l n="3">With sawcy Grief pity the helpless Fate</l>
     <l n="4">Of what they fear'd, almost ador'd of late.</l>
     <l n="5">So I the meanest that did e'er aspire,</l>
     <l n="6">To own herself of the Muses Empire;</l>
     <l n="7">Who scarcely can my Tribute pay,</l>
     <l n="8">To acknowledge their Imperial sway.</l>
     <l n="9">With arrogant, yet conscious Grief, presume,</l>
     <l n="10">To shed a Tear on their Vice-gerents awful Tomb:</l>
     <l n="11">Ah! who'd have thought that seeming deathless Man,</l>
     <l n="12">With every Art and Grace indow'd;</l>
     <l n="13">Should have a Life, but of the usual Span,</l>
     <l n="14">And shrink into a common Shroud.</l>
     <l n="15">But his unequall'd worth can never dy,</l>
     <l n="16">Nothing can e'er his matchless Laurels blast,</l>
     <l n="17">Tho'  self should be destroy'd and wast;</l>
     <l n="18">And in forgotten Ruins lie.</l>
     <l n="19">The ecchoing Trump of Fame his Glories will re-reherse,</l>
     <l n="20">To all the wondering Universe,</l>
     <l n="21">Till it Joyn sound with the Tremendious last.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="22">Sure Poets are not made of common Earth,</l>
     <l n="23">Or he at least may boast a nobler Birth;</l>
     <l n="24">Each Atom with soft Numbers was inspir'd,</l>
     <l n="25">And flowing Fancy with one lasting Rapture fir'd:</l>
     <l n="26">Altho' the mighty Secret's not disclos'd,</l>
     <l n="27">He surely was like  with artful Tunes compos'd.</l>
     <l n="28">The Voices of the sweet melodious Nine,</l>
     <l n="29">In Consort joyn'd  forming Lyre,</l>
     <l n="30">Did thousand purest particles Inspire;</l>
     <l n="31">With tuneful Measures Harmony Divine.</l>
     <l n="32">At the sacred commanding Sound,</l>
     <l n="33">With Animation passing vulgar Souls,</l>
     <l n="34">The knowing willing Atoms came,</l>
     <l n="35">None the creative Strains controuls;</l>
     <l n="36">But by energy of Ayrs Divine compound,</l>
     <l n="37">The almost omniscient Frame.</l>
     <l n="38">And for a Soul which scarce was wanting here,</l>
     <l n="39">In all the pre-existing Magazine,</l>
     <l n="40">Not one was seen;</l>
     <l n="41">Worthy in thy alloted Glories to appear.</l>
     <l n="42">No great  self, with his own Rays,</l>
     <l n="43">(For nothing less could the bright Form improve,)</l>
     <l n="44">Infus'd celestial Sapience from above;</l>
     <l n="45">To qualify thee for immortal Bays.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="46">once before a sacred Structure blest,</l>
     <l n="47">Where all the Inquisitive World did come,</l>
     <l n="48">For an ambiguous Doom;</l>
     <l n="49">And splendid Pomp amaz'd the curious Guest.</l>
     <l n="50">Yet with less Glory did at  shine,</l>
     <l n="51">When floors of Marble, roofs of Gold,</l>
     <l n="52">Did his oraculous God-head hold;</l>
     <l n="53">Then in thy living Shrine,</l>
     <l n="54">There fetter'd with a sacerdotal Yoke,</l>
     <l n="55">Uncheckt in thee, the God has always spoke.</l>
     <l n="56">In thee no less Magnificent appears,</l>
     <l n="57">Nor with less Splender did his Power exert,</l>
     <l n="58">Then when above a Soveraign sway he bears;</l>
     <l n="59">In Learning Poetry, and every Godlike Art.</l>
     <l n="60">But oh! the Deity is silenc'd now,</l>
     <l n="61">No more celestial Cadence from thy Tongue will flow,</l>
     <l n="62">And all the lesser Fanes with Grief expire,</l>
     <l n="63">All gasping ly,</l>
     <l n="64">With fainting Groans deplore,</l>
     <l n="65">Great  is no more;</l>
     <l n="66">And with declining Fire</l>
     <l n="67">Sing their own Requiem in thy Obsequie.</l>
     <l n="68">Farewel to Inspiration now,</l>
     <l n="69">All sacred extacies of Wit,</l>
     <l n="70">The softer Excellence,</l>
     <l n="71">Of melting Words and rapturing Sence,</l>
     <l n="72">Ye will no more with Divine Sweetness flow;</l>
     <l n="73">But Poetry submit</l>
     <l n="74">To the bold Enthusiastick Rage</l>
     <l n="75">Of a deserted and malicious Age.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="76">Only the Pythagorean Faith we doubt,</l>
     <l n="77">Else if thy great Soul should transmigrated be,</l>
     <l n="78">It might be parcell'd out</l>
     <l n="79">And stock each Age with Laureats till Eternity.</l>
     <l n="80">Ah! Where is thy harmonious Spirit now?</l>
     <l n="81">Teaching softer Numbers to the Sphears,</l>
     <l n="82">Or makes some Star with greater Lustre glow,</l>
     <l n="83">Or roamest in the extended Space thy long Eternity of Years.</l>
     <l n="84">No, toth' sacred softer Shades thou'rt gone,</l>
     <l n="85">The Souls of Poets needs must thither fly;</l>
     <l n="86">(I'm sure they Lovers live how e're they die.)</l>
     <l n="87">But thou so many Laurels here hast won,</l>
     <l n="88">As plants a new  of thy own.</l>
     <l n="89">Triumphant sit beneath th' immortal Shade,</l>
     <l n="90">Of ever blooming Wreaths which less than those will fade,</l>
     <l n="91">That are below for softest Lovers made.</l>
     <l n="92">Therefore the  Swain need not retreat,</l>
     <l n="93">But keep his antient Regal Seat;</l>
     <l n="94">Which else at thy Approach he would resign,</l>
     <l n="95">For well he knows Wit's sacred Throne is thine:</l>
     <l n="96">See he with Thanks salutes thy skilful Hand,</l>
     <l n="97">Which so successfully has taught;</l>
     <l n="98">His long fam'd Works the Language of our Land,</l>
     <l n="99">With Art in every Line, and Grace in every Thought.</l>
     <l n="100">None their intrinsick Value can deny,</l>
     <l n="101">The well plac'd Pride of antient ,</l>
     <l n="102">Polish'd by thee is now our Boast become;</l>
     <l n="103">Sparkling with all the Glories of true Poetry;</l>
     <l n="104">Receives from all a just and happier Doom.</l>
     <l n="105">and all the tuneful Poets there,</l>
     <l n="106">With Joys new dated celebrate thy Fame,</l>
     <l n="107">In an eternal soft celestial Air;</l>
     <l n="108">For all the Honours thou hast done the so long slighted Name.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="109">And we whom thou hast left behind,</l>
     <l n="110">Are all employ'd about thee too;</l>
     <l n="111">Altho thy Worth too great a Theme we find,</l>
     <l n="112">At least our Gratitude in Grief we show.</l>
     <l n="113">Our best Encomiums but prophane thy Name,</l>
     <l n="114">Unless successful  artful Line;</l>
     <l n="115">That only Rival of so great a Fame,</l>
     <l n="116">Can Justice do to thine.</l>
     <l n="117">My well meant  blushing I must rear,</l>
     <l n="118">Unkind  affords no Aid,</l>
     <l n="119">Tho' I so often beg'd and pray'd,</l>
     <l n="120">My softer Voice she would not hear.</l>
     <l n="121">Amongst the mighty Men she's busie now,</l>
     <l n="122">Tis they I find best charm immortal Females too;</l>
     <l n="123">Tho' she'll not teach how I shall Numbers keep,</l>
     <l n="124">My Admiration in Heroick's dress,</l>
     <l n="125">Or in a softer Ode my Griefs express,</l>
     <l n="126">Tis my own Fault being Woman, if I fail to weep.</l>
     <l n="127">Since this great Man insatiate Fate obey'd,</l>
     <l n="128">How is Wit's Empire lessen'd and decay'd?</l>
     <l n="129">It scarce a Province now appears,</l>
     <l n="130">Come then let's joyn our Tears;</l>
     <l n="131">Cease not till an Ocean flow,</l>
     <l n="132">Twine round the Muses Plat, till it an Island grow,</l>
     <l n="133">There let's possess her constant Joys,</l>
     <l n="134">Spite, Poverty and Noise.</l>
     <l n="135">Tho' bounded safe with a  Sea,</l>
     <l n="136">They ne'er must hope their Isles the Fortunate will be.</l>
