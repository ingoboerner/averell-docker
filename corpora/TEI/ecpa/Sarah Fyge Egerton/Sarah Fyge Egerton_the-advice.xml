     <l n="1">, busie Soul, let distant Things alone,</l>
     <l n="2">Only the present Time's thy own;</l>
     <l n="3">Leave to the Gods what shall hereafter be,</l>
     <l n="4">Forbear the Search of dark Futurity.</l>
     <l n="5">If thou'lt at once more than one Minute live,</l>
     <l n="6">Thou must design or dread or grieve;</l>
     <l n="7">In turning back Remembrance represents,</l>
     <l n="8">Black Images of Discontent.</l>
     <l n="9">What happen'd to torment a Year ago,</l>
     <l n="10">Altho' it really ceases to do so?</l>
     <l n="11">If thou will't ruminate, 'tis still A Woe.</l>
     <l n="12">Thus what is past will always present be,</l>
     <l n="13">And in Idea ever torture thee;</l>
     <l n="14">On Pleasures too if we reflect,</l>
     <l n="15">They have the same unkind Effect;</l>
     <l n="16">We are as angry they are past,</l>
     <l n="17">As at those Griefs which we compel to last:</l>
     <l n="18">But tell me, partial Soul, ah tell me why?</l>
     <l n="19">Things of such Contrariety,</l>
     <l n="20">In thy Revolves should be the same to thee.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="21">One deep obliterating Draught of Lethe take,</l>
     <l n="22">Blot all the torturing Records out;</l>
     <l n="23">Yet then thou'lt not be bless'd I doubt,</l>
     <l n="24">But nice Inquiries make.</l>
     <l n="25">Yes, the forbidden Book of Fate,</l>
     <l n="26">Thou needs must pry into with curious Eyes,</l>
     <l n="27">By'ts unintelligible Lines thy Actions state,</l>
     <l n="28">Where nothing's plain unless the Curse of being Wise.</l>
     <l n="29">Now Form great threatning Monsters in thy Brain,</l>
     <l n="30">Then rack thy Skill to have the Phantoms slain;</l>
     <l n="31">In the safe present Scene thou wilt not rest,</l>
     <l n="32">But in remoter Things be bless'd.</l>
     <l n="33">This or that distant Joy propose,</l>
     <l n="34">And much of Life extravagantly lose,</l>
     <l n="35">In Search of what Fate will elsewhere dispose.</l>
     <l n="36">Thy Plots and Forecasts thou conceiv'st in vain,</l>
     <l n="37">Links of th' inevitable Chain;</l>
     <l n="38">Short-sighted Soul thou canst not see,</l>
     <l n="39">What shall to Morrow be,</l>
     <l n="40">Yet wilt indulge thy fruitless Curiosity.</l>
     <l n="41">So some unlucky Engineer</l>
     <l n="42">Does all the fit Materials compound,</l>
     <l n="43">That are in Art or Nature found;</l>
     <l n="44">Will glorious Fire-Works prepare.</l>
     <l n="45">(Fancies he sees his various Comets rise,</l>
     <l n="46">Outshine and mount up to their radiant likeness in the Skys;)</l>
     <l n="47">Thinks they will satisfie his Pride and Cost,</l>
     <l n="48">But ah! he hopes in vain.</l>
     <l n="49">For almost finish'd ere he is aware,</l>
     <l n="50">A Spark by chance lights in the Train,</l>
     <l n="51">And all with one afrighting Blaze is inconfusion lost.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="52">Since thou, my Soul, must grieve or bafl'd be,</l>
     <l n="53">For once be rul'd by me;</l>
     <l n="54">No more reflect,</l>
     <l n="55">No more with studious Care project,</l>
     <l n="56">Nor look beyond thy present Destiny.</l>
     <l n="57">I charge thee ne'er contrive no more,</l>
     <l n="58">Thou'lt fare no better than thou didst before;</l>
     <l n="59">With  mistaken Joys prepare,</l>
     <l n="60">Thy fond Embrace for the delusive Air;</l>
     <l n="61">So often fool'd ne'er hope to win at last,</l>
     <l n="62">Thy future Doom's stamp'd with thy Past.</l>
     <l n="63">Then Fate doth seem with her own Hand,</l>
     <l n="64">To lead to the self-promis'd Land;</l>
     <l n="65">Yet e'er our weary'd Steps reach the long wish'd for Ground,</l>
     <l n="66">Storms and Darkness doth surround,</l>
     <l n="67">And the gay Prospect can no more be found.</l>
     <l n="68">Tho' we by chance (a mighty Chance indeed,)</l>
     <l n="69">Should to our selves propose what is decreed:</l>
     <l n="70">Yet to my Cost this Truth I've learn'd,</l>
     <l n="71">With passive Ease we should be unconcern'd:</l>
     <l n="72">For Fate of our Designs no Use will make,</l>
     <l n="73">But her own mysterious Methods take.</l>
     <l n="74">Then why do we perplex our selves in vain,</l>
     <l n="75">For what we know not how to get, or whether we must gain?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="76">Then live to Day, design nor fear no more,</l>
     <l n="77">Nor grieve upon a former Score:</l>
     <l n="78">What was once is gone,</l>
     <l n="79">And that which we expect may ne'er come on.</l>
     <l n="80">Those who on Yesterdays and Morrows live,</l>
     <l n="81">Neglect what Heaven does really give;</l>
     <l n="82">Which only is the present Day,</l>
     <l n="83">And that in fleeting Moments posts away;</l>
     <l n="84">Let me enjoy each Minute then,</l>
     <l n="85">Not starve to Day, to feast I know not when;</l>
     <l n="86">Since the full Glass at the inviting Lip,</l>
     <l n="87">From the too cautious Hand may slip.</l>
     <l n="88">Give me ye Gods my Blessings now,</l>
     <l n="89">On th' expecting Man your future Gifts bestow.</l>
     <l n="90">They who the present Hour neglect,</l>
     <l n="91">Because an other better they expect:</l>
     <l n="92">Useful Estates do pass away,</l>
     <l n="93">For future Pay;</l>
     <l n="94">Are always Creditors to Fate,</l>
     <l n="95">And she too often pays too late;</l>
     <l n="96">There's none but Fools procrastinate.</l>
