    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">the black Days of Universal Doom,</l>
     <l n="2">Which wond'rous Prophecies foretold, are come;</l>
     <l n="3">What strong Convulsions, what stupendous Woe,</l>
     <l n="4">Must sinking Nature undergo,</l>
     <l n="5">Amidst the dreadful Wreck, and final Overthrow.</l>
     <l n="6">Methinks I hear her, conscious of her Fate,</l>
     <l n="7">With fearful Groans, and hideous Cries,</l>
     <l n="8">Fill the presaging Skies;</l>
     <l n="9">Unable to support the weight,</l>
     <l n="10">Or of the present, or approaching Miseries.</l>
     <l n="11">Methinks I hear her summon all,</l>
     <l n="12">Her guilty Off-spring, raving with Despair,</l>
     <l n="13">And trembling, cry aloud, prepare,</l>
     <l n="14">Ye Sublunary Pow'rs t' attend my Funeral!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="15">See, see the tragical Portents,</l>
     <l n="16">Those dismal Harbingers of dire Events!</l>
     <l n="17">Loud Thunders roar, and darting Light'nings fly</l>
     <l n="18">Through the dark Concave of the troubled Sky:</l>
     <l n="19">The fiery Ravage is begun, the End is nigh,</l>
     <l n="20">See how the glaring Meteors blaze!</l>
     <l n="21">Like baleful Torches, O they come,</l>
     <l n="22">To light dissolving Nature to her Tomb!</l>
     <l n="23">And scatt'ring round their pestilential Rays,</l>
     <l n="24">Strike the affrighted Nations with a wild Amaze.</l>
     <l n="25">Vast Sheets of Flame, and Globes of Fire,</l>
     <l n="26">By an impetuous Wind are driven,</l>
     <l n="27">Thro' all the Regions of th' inferior Heaven,</l>
     <l n="28">Till hid in sulph'rous Smoke, they seemingly expire.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="29">Sad and amazing 'tis to see,</l>
     <l n="30">What mad confusion rages over all</l>
     <l n="31">This scorching Ball!</l>
     <l n="32">No Country is exempt, no Nation free,</l>
     <l n="33">But each partakes the Epidemic Misery.</l>
     <l n="34">What dismal havock of Mankind is made</l>
     <l n="35">By Wars, and Pestilence, and Dearth,</l>
     <l n="36">Thro' the whole mournful Earth?</l>
     <l n="37">Which with a murdering Fury they invade,</l>
     <l n="38">Forsook by Providence, and all propitious Aid.</l>
     <l n="39">Whilst Fiends let loose, their utmost Rage employ</l>
     <l n="40">To ruin all things here below;</l>
     <l n="41">Their Malice and Revenge no Limits know,</l>
     <l n="42">But, in the universal tumult, all destroy.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="43">Distracted Mortals from their Cities fly</l>
     <l n="44">For safety to their Champian Ground,</l>
     <l n="45">But there no safety can be found;</l>
     <l n="46">The Vengeance of an angry Deity,</l>
     <l n="47">With unrelenting Fury does inclose them round.</l>
     <l n="48">And whilst for Mercy some aloud implore</l>
     <l n="49">The God, they ridicul'd before;</l>
     <l n="50">And others raving with their woe,</l>
     <l n="51">(For Hunger, Thirst, Despair they undergo,)</l>
     <l n="52">Blaspheme and curse the Power they should adore.</l>
     <l n="53">The Earth, parch'd up with Drought, her Jaws extend,</l>
     <l n="54">And opening wide a dreadful Tomb,</l>
     <l n="55">The howling Multitude, at once, descends,</l>
     <l n="56">Together all into her burning Womb.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="57">The trembling  abscond their aged Heads</l>
     <l n="58">In mighty Pillars of Infernal Smoke,</l>
     <l n="59">Which from their bellowing Caverns broke,</l>
     <l n="60">And suffocates whole Nations where it spreads.</l>
     <l n="61">Sometimes the Fire within divides</l>
     <l n="62">The massy Rivers of those secret Chains,</l>
     <l n="63">Which hold together their prodigious Sides,</l>
     <l n="64">And hurls the shatter'd Rocks o'er all the Plains</l>
     <l n="65">While Towns and Cities, ev'ry thing below,</l>
     <l n="66">Is overwhelmed with the same burst of Woe.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="67">No Showers descend from the malignant Sky,</l>
     <l n="68">To cool the Burnings of the thirsty Field;</l>
     <l n="69">The Trees no Leaves, no Grass the Meadows yield,</l>
     <l n="70">But all is barren, all is dry.</l>
     <l n="71">The little Rivulets no more</l>
     <l n="72">To larger Streams their tribute pay,</l>
     <l n="73">Nor to the ebbing Ocean, they</l>
     <l n="74">Which with a strange unusual roar,</l>
     <l n="75">Forsakes those antient Bounds it would have pass'd before,</l>
     <l n="76">And to the monstrous Deep in vain retires;</l>
     <l n="77">For ev'n the Deep it self is not secure,</l>
     <l n="78">But belching subterraneous Fires,</l>
     <l n="79">Increases still the scalding Calenture,</l>
     <l n="80">Which neither Earth, nor Air, nor Water can endure.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="81">The Sun by Sympathy concern'd,</l>
     <l n="82">At those Convulsions, Pangs, and Agonies,</l>
     <l n="83">Which on the whole Creation seize,</l>
     <l n="84">Is to substantial Darkness turn'd.</l>
     <l n="85">The neighb'ring Moon, as if a purple Flood,</l>
     <l n="86">O'erflow'd her tottering Orb, appears</l>
     <l n="87">Like a huge mass of black corrupting Blood;</l>
     <l n="88">For she her self a Dissolution fears.</l>
     <l n="89">The larger Planets, which once shone so bright,</l>
     <l n="90">With the reflected Rays of borrow'd Light,</l>
     <l n="91">Shook from their Center, without motion lie,</l>
     <l n="92">Unweildy Globes of solid Night,</l>
     <l n="93">And ruinous Lumber of the Sky.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="94">Amidst this dreadful Hurricane of Woes,</l>
     <l n="95">(For Fire, Confusion, Horror and Despair,</l>
     <l n="96">Fill ev'ry Region of the tortur'd Earth and Air;)</l>
     <l n="97">The great Archangel his loud Trumpet blows,</l>
     <l n="98">At whose amazing Sound, fresh Agonies</l>
     <l n="99">Upon expiring Nature seize;</l>
     <l n="100">For now she'll in few Minutes know</l>
     <l n="101">Th' ultimate Event and Fate of all below.</l>
     <l n="102">Awake, ye Dead, awake he cries</l>
     <l n="103">For all must come,</l>
     <l n="104">All that had Human Breath, arise,</l>
     <l n="105">To hear your last unalterable Doom.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="106">At this the ghastly Tyrant, who had sway'd</l>
     <l n="107">So many thousand Ages uncontroul'd,</l>
     <l n="108">No longer could his Scepter hold,</l>
     <l n="109">But gave up all, and was himself a Captive made.</l>
     <l n="110">The scatter'd Particles of Human Clay,</l>
     <l n="111">Which in the silent Grave's dark Chambers lay,</l>
     <l n="112">Resume their pristine Forms agen,</l>
     <l n="113">And now from mortal, grow immortal Men.</l>
     <l n="114">Stupendous Energy of sacred Pow'r,</l>
     <l n="115">Which can collect, where-ever cast;</l>
     <l n="116">The smallest Atoms, and that shape restore,</l>
     <l n="117">Which they had worn so many Years before,</l>
     <l n="118">Tho' thro' strange Accidents and numerous Changes past.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="119">See how the joyful Angels fly</l>
     <l n="120">From ev'ry Quarter of the Sky,</l>
     <l n="121">To gather, and to convoy all,</l>
     <l n="122">The pious Sons of human Race,</l>
     <l n="123">To one capacious place,</l>
     <l n="124">Above the Confines of this flaming Ball.</l>
     <l n="125">See with what tenderness and love they bear</l>
     <l n="126">Those righteous Souls thro' the tumultuous Air;</l>
     <l n="127">Whilst the ungodly stand below,</l>
     <l n="128">Raging with shame, confusion, and despair,</l>
     <l n="129">Amidst the burning overthrow,</l>
     <l n="130">Expecting fiercer Torments, and acuter Woe.</l>
     <l n="131">Round them Infernal Spirits howling Fly;</l>
     <l n="132">O Horror, Curses, Tortures, Chains, they cry,</l>
     <l n="133">And roar aloud with execrable Blasphemy.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="134">Hark how the daring Sons of Infamy</l>
     <l n="135">Who once dissolv'd in Pleasures lay,</l>
     <l n="136">And laugh'd at this tremendous Day,</l>
     <l n="137">To Rocks and Mountains now to hide 'em cry;</l>
     <l n="138">But Rocks and Mountains all in Ashes lie.</l>
     <l n="139">Their Shame's so mighty, and so strong their Fear,</l>
     <l n="140">That rather than appear</l>
     <l n="141">Before a God incens'd, they would be hurl'd</l>
     <l n="142">Amongst the burning Ruins of the World,</l>
     <l n="143">And lie conceal'd, if possible, for ever there.</l>
     <l n="144">Time was, they would not own a Deity,</l>
     <l n="145">Nor after Death a future state;</l>
     <l n="146">But now, by sad Experience find too late,</l>
     <l n="147">There is, and terrible to that degree,</l>
     <l n="148">That, rather than behold his Face, they'd cease to be.</l>
     <l n="149">And sure 'tis better, if Heav'n would give consent,</l>
     <l n="150">To have no Being; but they must remain</l>
     <l n="151">For ever, and for ever be in pain.</l>
     <l n="152">O inexpressible stupendous Punishment,</l>
     <l n="153">Which cannot be endur'd, yet must be underwent.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="154">But now the Eastern Skies expanding wide,</l>
     <l n="155">The glorious Judge Omnipotent descends,</l>
     <l n="156">And to the Sublunary World his Passage bends;</l>
     <l n="157">Where, cloath'd with Human Nature, he did once reside.</l>
     <l n="158">Round him the bright Ethereal Armies Fly,</l>
     <l n="159">And loud triumphant  sing,</l>
     <l n="160">With Songs of Praise, and Hymns of Victory</l>
     <l n="161">To their Celestial King,</l>
     <l n="162">All Glory, Pow'r, Dominion, Majesty,</l>
     <l n="163">Now and for everlasting Ages be,</l>
     <l n="164">To the Essential , and Coeternal .</l>
     <l n="165">Perish that World, as 'tis decreed,</l>
     <l n="166">Which saw the God Incarnate bleed!</l>
     <l n="167">Perish by thy Almighty Vengeance those</l>
     <l n="168">Who durst thy Person, or thy Laws expose.</l>
     <l n="169">The cursed Refuse of Mankind, and Hell's proud Seed</l>
     <l n="170">Now to the unbelieving Nations show,</l>
     <l n="171">Thou art a God from all Eternity;</l>
     <l n="172">Not titular, or but by Office so;</l>
     <l n="173">And let 'em the mysterious Union see,</l>
     <l n="174">Of Human Nature with the Deity.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="175">With mighty transports, yet with awful fears,</l>
     <l n="176">The Good behold this glorious Sight,</l>
     <l n="177">Their  in all his Majesty appears,</l>
     <l n="178">Ineffable, amazing bright,</l>
     <l n="179">And seated on a Throne of everlasting Light.</l>
     <l n="180">Round the Tribunal, next to the most High,</l>
     <l n="181">In sacred Discipline and Order stand,</l>
     <l n="182">The Peers and Princes of the Sky,</l>
     <l n="183">As they excel in Glory or Command.</l>
     <l n="184">Upon the Right Hand that Illustrious Croud</l>
     <l n="185">In the white Bosom of a shining Cloud,</l>
     <l n="186">Whose Souls abhorring all ignoble Crimes,</l>
     <l n="187">Did with a steady Course pursue</l>
     <l n="188">His holy Precepts, in the worst of times;</l>
     <l n="189">Maugre what Earth, or Hell, what Men or Devils could</l>
     <l n="190">And now that God they did to Death adore,</l>
     <l n="191">For whom such Torments and such Pains they bore,</l>
     <l n="192">Returns to place them on those Thrones above,</l>
     <l n="193">Where undisturb'd, uncloy'd, they will possess</l>
     <l n="194">Divine substantial Happiness,</l>
     <l n="195">Unbounded as his Pow'r, and lasting as his Love.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="196">Go bring, the Judge impartial, frowning cries,</l>
     <l n="197">Those Rebel Sons, who did my Laws despise;</l>
     <l n="198">Whom neither threat, nor promises could move,</l>
     <l n="199">Not all my Sufferings, nor all my Love,</l>
     <l n="200">To save themselves from everlasting Miseries.</l>
     <l n="201">At this ten Millions of Archangels Flew</l>
     <l n="202">Swifter than Lightning, or the swiftest thought,</l>
     <l n="203">And less than in an instant brought,</l>
     <l n="204">The wretched, curs'd infernal Crew,</l>
     <l n="205">Who with distorted Aspects come,</l>
     <l n="206">To hear their sad intolerable Doom.</l>
     <l n="207">Alas! they cry, one Beam of Mercy show,</l>
     <l n="208">Thou all-forgiving Deity!</l>
     <l n="209">To pardon Crimes is natural to thee;</l>
     <l n="210">Crush us to nothing, or suspend our Woe:</l>
     <l n="211">But if it cannot, cannot be,</l>
     <l n="212">And we must go into a Gulph of Fire,</l>
     <l n="213">(For who can with Omnipotence contend;)</l>
     <l n="214">Grant, for thou art a God, it may at last expire,</l>
     <l n="215">And all our Tortures have an end.</l>
     <l n="216">Eternal Burnings, O we cannot bear!</l>
     <l n="217">Tho' now our Bodies too Immortal are,</l>
     <l n="218">Let 'em be pungent to the last degree;</l>
     <l n="219">And let our Pains innumerable be,</l>
     <l n="220">But let 'em not extend to all Eternity.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="221">Loe now, there does no place remain</l>
     <l n="222">For penitence, and tears, but all</l>
     <l n="223">Must by their Actions stand or fall:</l>
     <l n="224">To hope for pity is in vain,</l>
     <l n="225">The Dye is cast, and not to be recall'd again.</l>
     <l n="226">Two mighty Books are by two Angels brought,</l>
     <l n="227">In this, impartially recorded, stands</l>
     <l n="228">The Laws of Nature, and Divine Commands,</l>
     <l n="229">In that, each Action, Word and Thought,</l>
     <l n="230">Whate'er was said in secret, or in secret wrought.</l>
     <l n="231">Then first the Virtuous, and the Good,</l>
     <l n="232">Who all the Fury of Temptation stood,</l>
     <l n="233">And bravely pass'd thro' Ignominy, Chains and Blood;</l>
     <l n="234">Attended by their Guardian Angels, come</l>
     <l n="235">To the tremendous Bar of final Doom.</l>
     <l n="236">In vain the grand Accuser, railing brings,</l>
     <l n="237">A long Indictment of enormous Things,</l>
     <l n="238">Whose Guilt wip'd off by penitential Tears,</l>
     <l n="239">And their Redeemer's Blood and Agonies,</l>
     <l n="240">No more to their astonishment appears,</l>
     <l n="241">But in the secret Womb of dark Oblivion lies.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16">
     <l n="242">Come now, my Friends, he cries, ye Sons of Grace,</l>
     <l n="243">Partakers once of all my Wrongs and Shame,</l>
     <l n="244">Despis'd and hated for my Name.</l>
     <l n="245">Come to your Saviour's, and your God's Embrace!</l>
     <l n="246">Ascend, and those bright Diadems possess,</l>
     <l n="247">For you by my Eternal Father made,</l>
     <l n="248">E'er the Foundation of the World was laid;</l>
     <l n="249">And that surprizing Happiness,</l>
     <l n="250">Immense as my own Godhead, and will ne'er be less.</l>
     <l n="251">For when I languishing in Prison lay,</l>
     <l n="252">Naked and starv'd almost for want of Bread,</l>
     <l n="253">You did your kindly Visits pay,</l>
     <l n="254">Both cloath'd my Body, and my Hunger fed.</l>
     <l n="255">Wearied with Sickness, or oppress'd with Grief,</l>
     <l n="256">Your hand was always ready to supply:</l>
     <l n="257">When-e'er I wanted, you were always by,</l>
     <l n="258">To share my Sorrows, or to give Relief.</l>
     <l n="259">In all Distress, so tender was your Love,</l>
     <l n="260">I could no anxious trouble bear,</l>
     <l n="261">No black Misfortune, or vexatious Care,</l>
     <l n="262">But you were still impatient to remove,</l>
     <l n="263">And mourn'd, your charitable Hand, should unsuccessful prove,</l>
     <l n="264">All this you did, tho' not to me</l>
     <l n="265">In Person, yet to mine in Misery;</l>
     <l n="266">And shall for ever live</l>
     <l n="267">In all the Glories that a  can give,</l>
     <l n="268">Or a created Being's able to receive.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17">
     <l n="269">At this the Architects Divine on high</l>
     <l n="270">Innumerable Thrones of Glory raise,</l>
     <l n="271">On which they, in appointed Order, place</l>
     <l n="272">The Human Coheirs of Eternity;</l>
     <l n="273">And with united Hymns the  Incarnate praise.</l>
     <l n="274">O Holy, Holy, Holy Lord,</l>
     <l n="275">Eternal God, Almighty ,</l>
     <l n="276">Be thou for ever, and be thou alone,</l>
     <l n="277">By all thy Creatures constantly ador'd!</l>
     <l n="278">Ineffable Coequal ,</l>
     <l n="279">Who from Non-entity gave Birth</l>
     <l n="280">To Angels, and to Men, to Heaven and to Earth;</l>
     <l n="281">Yet always was thy self, and will for ever be.</l>
     <l n="282">But for thy Mercy, we had ne'er possest</l>
     <l n="283">These Thrones, and this immense Felicity,</l>
     <l n="284">Could ne'er have been so infinitely blest:</l>
     <l n="285">Therefore all Glory, Power, Dominion, Majesty,</l>
     <l n="286">To thee, O Lamb of God, to thee,</l>
     <l n="287">For ever, longer than for ever be.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18">
     <l n="288">Then the Incarnate Godhead turns his Face</l>
     <l n="289">To those upon the Left, and cries,</l>
     <l n="290">(Almighty Vengeance Flashing in his Eyes)</l>
     <l n="291">Ye impious, unbelieving Race,</l>
     <l n="292">To those eternal Torments go,</l>
     <l n="293">Prepar'd for those Rebellious Sons of Light,</l>
     <l n="294">In burning Darkness, and in Flaming Night;</l>
     <l n="295">Which shall no limit or cessation know,</l>
     <l n="296">But always are extream, and always will be so.</l>
     <l n="297">The final Sentence pass'd, a dreadful Cloud,</l>
     <l n="298">Inclosing all the miserable Croud,</l>
     <l n="299">A mighty Hurricane of Thunder rose,</l>
     <l n="300">And hurl'd 'em all into a Lake of Fire,</l>
     <l n="301">Which never, never, never can expire:</l>
     <l n="302">The vast Abyss of endless Woes.</l>
     <l n="303">Whilst with their , the Righteous mount on high,</l>
     <l n="304">In glorious triumph passing thro' the Sky,</l>
     <l n="305">To Joys immense, and everlasting Extasy.</l>
