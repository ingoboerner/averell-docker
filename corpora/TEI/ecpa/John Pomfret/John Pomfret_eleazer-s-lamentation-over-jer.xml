    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">, Alas! where's now</l>
     <l n="2">Thy pristine Glory, thy unmatch'd Renown</l>
     <l n="3">To which the Heathen Monarchies did bow,</l>
     <l n="4">Ah hapless, miserable Town!</l>
     <l n="5">Where's all thy Majesty, thy Beauty gone?</l>
     <l n="6">Thou once most noble celebrated place,</l>
     <l n="7">The Joy, and the Delight of all the Earth;</l>
     <l n="8">Who gav'st to God-like Princes Birth,</l>
     <l n="9">And bred up Heroes, an immortal Race.</l>
     <l n="10">Where's now the vast Magnificence which made</l>
     <l n="11">The Souls of Foreigners adore</l>
     <l n="12">Thy wond'rous Brightness, which no more</l>
     <l n="13">Shall shine, but lie in an eternal Shade.</l>
     <l n="14">Oh Misery! where's all her mighty State,</l>
     <l n="15">Her splendid Train of numerous Kings,</l>
     <l n="16">Her noble Edifices, noble Things,</l>
     <l n="17">Which made her seem so eminently Great?</l>
     <l n="18">That barb'rous Princes in her Gates appear'd,</l>
     <l n="19">And wealthy Presents, as their Tribute brought,</l>
     <l n="20">To court her Friendship, for her Strength they fear'd,</l>
     <l n="21">And all her wide Protection sought.</l>
     <l n="22">But now, ah, now they laugh, and cry,</l>
     <l n="23">See how her lofty Buildings lie,</l>
     <l n="24">See how her flaming Turrets gild the Sky!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="25">Where's all the Young, the Valiant, and the Gay</l>
     <l n="26">That on her Festivals were us'd to play</l>
     <l n="27">Harmonious Tunes, and beautify the Day?</l>
     <l n="28">The glittering Troops, which did from far</l>
     <l n="29">Bring home the Trophies, and the Spoils of War.</l>
     <l n="30">Whom all the Nations round with Terror view'd,</l>
     <l n="31">Nor durst their God-like Valour try,</l>
     <l n="32">Where-e'er they fought, they certainly subdu'd,</l>
     <l n="33">And ev'ry Combat gain'd a Victory.</l>
     <l n="34">Ah! where's the House of the Eternal King,</l>
     <l n="35">The beauteous Temple of the Lord of Hosts,</l>
     <l n="36">To whose large Treasuries our Fleets did bring</l>
     <l n="37">The Gold, and Jewels of remotest Coasts;</l>
     <l n="38">There had the Infinite Creator plac'd</l>
     <l n="39">His terrible, amazing Name:</l>
     <l n="40">And with his more peculiar Presence grac'd</l>
     <l n="41">That Heav'nly , where no Mortal came,</l>
     <l n="42">The  only, he but once a Year,</l>
     <l n="43">In that Divine Apartment might appear:</l>
     <l n="44">So full of Glory, and so sacred then,</l>
     <l n="45">But now corrupted with the Heaps of Slain,</l>
     <l n="46">Which scatter'd round with Blood, defile the mighty Fane.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="47">Alas ! each spacious Street</l>
     <l n="48">Was once so fill'd, the numerous Throng</l>
     <l n="49">Were forc'd to justle as they pass'd along;</l>
     <l n="50">And Thousands did with Thousands meet,</l>
     <l n="51">The Darling then of God, and Man's belov'd Retreat.</l>
     <l n="52">In thee was the bright Throne of Justice fixt,</l>
     <l n="53">Justice impartial, and with Fraud unmixt.</l>
     <l n="54">She scorn'd the Beauties of fallacious Gold,</l>
     <l n="55">Despising the most wealthy Bribes;</l>
     <l n="56">But did the sacred Balance hold</l>
     <l n="57">With God-like Faith to all our happy Tribes.</l>
     <l n="58">Thy well-built Streets, and ev'ry noble Square,</l>
     <l n="59">Were once with polish'd Marble laid,</l>
     <l n="60">And all thy lofty Bull-warks made</l>
     <l n="61">With wond'rous Labour, and with artful Care.</l>
     <l n="62">Thy pond'rous Gates, surprizing to behold,</l>
     <l n="63">Were cover'd o'er with solid Gold;</l>
     <l n="64">Whose Splendour did so glorious appear,</l>
     <l n="65">It ravish'd and amaz'd the Eye;</l>
     <l n="66">And Strangers passing, to themselves wou'd cry,</l>
     <l n="67">What mighty Heaps of Wealth are here!</l>
     <l n="68">How thick the Bars of massy Silver lie?</l>
     <l n="69">O happy People! and still happy be,</l>
     <l n="70">Celestial City! from Destruction free,</l>
     <l n="71">May'st thou enjoy a long entire Prosperity.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="72">But now, oh wretched, wretched place!</l>
     <l n="73">Thy Streets and Palaces are spread</l>
     <l n="74">With heaps of Carcasses, and Mountains of the Dead,</l>
     <l n="75">The bleeding Relicks of the  Race:</l>
     <l n="76">Each corner of the Town, no vacant space,</l>
     <l n="77">But is with breathless Bodies fill'd;</l>
     <l n="78">Some by the Sword, and some by Famine kill'd.</l>
     <l n="79">Natives and Strangers are together laid,</l>
     <l n="80">Death's Arrows all at random flew</l>
     <l n="81">Amongst the Crowd, and no distinction made</l>
     <l n="82">But both the Coward and the Valiant slew.</l>
     <l n="83">All in one dismal Ruin joyn'd,</l>
     <l n="84">(For Swords and Pestilence are blind;)</l>
     <l n="85">The fair, the good, the brave, no Mercy find;</l>
     <l n="86">Those that from far, with joyful haste,</l>
     <l n="87">Came to attend thy Festival,</l>
     <l n="88">Of the same bitter Potion taste,</l>
     <l n="89">And by the black destructive Poison fall,</l>
     <l n="90">For the avenging Sentence pass'd on all.</l>
     <l n="91">Oh! see how the delight of human Eyes</l>
     <l n="92">In horrid Desolation lies!</l>
     <l n="93">See how the burning Ruins flame,</l>
     <l n="94">Nothing now left, but a sad empty Name;</l>
     <l n="95">And the triumphant Victor cries,</l>
     <l n="96">This was the fam'd !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="97">The most obdurate Creature must</l>
     <l n="98">Be griev'd to see thy Palaces in Dust,</l>
     <l n="99">Those antient Habitations of the Just:</l>
     <l n="100">And could the Marble Rocks but know</l>
     <l n="101">The Mis'ries of thy fatal overthrow,</l>
     <l n="102">They'd strive to find some secret way unknown,</l>
     <l n="103">Maugre the sensless Nature of the Stone,</l>
     <l n="104">Their pity, and concern to show.</l>
     <l n="105">For now, where lofty Buildings stood,</l>
     <l n="106">Thy Sons corrupted Carasses are laid;</l>
     <l n="107">And all by this Destruction made</l>
     <l n="108">One common , one Field of Blood.</l>
     <l n="109">See! how those antient Men, which rul'd thy State,</l>
     <l n="110">And made thee happy, made thee great,</l>
     <l n="111">Who sat upon the awful Chair</l>
     <l n="112">Of mighty , in long Scarlet clad,</l>
     <l n="113">The good to cherish, and chastise the bad;</l>
     <l n="114">Now sit in the corrupted Air,</l>
     <l n="115">In silent Melancholy, and in sad Despair?</l>
     <l n="116">See! how their murder'd Children round 'em lie!</l>
     <l n="117">Ah dismal Scene! hark how they cry!</l>
     <l n="118">Woe! woe! one Beam of Mercy give,</l>
     <l n="119">Good Heaven! Alas, for we would live!</l>
     <l n="120">Be pitiful, and suffer us to die!</l>
     <l n="121">Thus they lament, thus beg for Ease,</l>
     <l n="122">While in their feeble aged Arms they hold</l>
     <l n="123">The Bodies of the Off-spring, stiff and cold,</l>
     <l n="124">To guard 'em from the rav'nous Savages:</l>
     <l n="125">Till their increasing Sorrows Death perswade</l>
     <l n="126">(For Death must sure with pity see</l>
     <l n="127">The horrid Desolation he has made)</l>
     <l n="128">To put a period to their Misery.</l>
     <l n="129">Thy wretched Daughters that survive,</l>
     <l n="130">Are by the Heathen kept alive</l>
     <l n="131">Only to gratify their Lust,</l>
     <l n="132">And then be mixt with common Dust.</l>
     <l n="133">Oh! insupportable, stupendious Woe!</l>
     <l n="134">What shall we do? Ah! whither shall we go?</l>
     <l n="135">Down to the Grave, down to those happy Shades below!</l>
     <l n="136">Where all our brave Progenitors are blest</l>
     <l n="137">With endless Triumphs, and eternal Rest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="138">But who without a Flood of Tears can see</l>
     <l n="139">Thy mournful sad Catastrophe?</l>
     <l n="140">Who can behold thy glorious Temple lie</l>
     <l n="141">In Ashes, and not be in pain to die?</l>
     <l n="142">Unhappy, dear ! thy Woes</l>
     <l n="143">Have rais'd my Griefs to such a vast excess,</l>
     <l n="144">Their mighty Weight no Mortal knows,</l>
     <l n="145">Thought cannot comprehend, or Words express,</l>
     <l n="146">Nor can they possibly, while I survive, be less.</l>
     <l n="147">Good Heaven had been extreamly kind,</l>
     <l n="148">If it had struck me dead, or struck me blind,</l>
     <l n="149">Before this cursed time, this worst of Days.</l>
     <l n="150">Is Death quite tir'd, are all his Arrows spent?</l>
     <l n="151">If not, why then so many dull Delays?</l>
     <l n="152">Quick, quick, let the obliging Dart be sent!</l>
     <l n="153">Nay, at me only, let ten Thousand fly,</l>
     <l n="154">Who e'er shall wretchedly survive, that I</l>
     <l n="155">May, happily, be sure to die.</l>
     <l n="156">Yet still we live, live in excess of pain,</l>
     <l n="157">Our Friends and Relatives are slain;</l>
     <l n="158">Nothing but Ruins round us see,</l>
     <l n="159">Nothing but Desolation, Woe, and Misery!</l>
     <l n="160">Nay, while we thus with bleeding Hearts complain,</l>
     <l n="161">Our Enemies without, prepare</l>
     <l n="162">Their direful Engines to pursue the War;</l>
     <l n="163">And you must slavishly preserve your Breath,</l>
     <l n="164">Or seek for Freedom in the Arms of Death.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="165">Thus then resolve, nor tremble at the thought,</l>
     <l n="166">Can Glory be too dearly bought?</l>
     <l n="167">Since the Almighty Wisdom has decreed</l>
     <l n="168">That we, and all our Progeny, should bleed,</l>
     <l n="169">It shall be after such a noble way,</l>
     <l n="170">Succeeding Ages will with wonder view,</l>
     <l n="171">What brave Despair compell'd us to:</l>
     <l n="172">No, we will ne'er survive another Day.</l>
     <l n="173">Bring then your Wives, your Children, all</l>
     <l n="174">That's valuable, good, or dear,</l>
     <l n="175">With ready Hands, and place 'em here;</l>
     <l n="176">They shall unite in one vast Funeral.</l>
     <l n="177">I know your Courages are truly brave,</l>
     <l n="178">And dare do any thing, but ill;</l>
     <l n="179">Who would an aged Father save,</l>
     <l n="180">That he may live in Chains, and be a Slave,</l>
     <l n="181">Or for remorsless Enemies to kill?</l>
     <l n="182">Let your bold Hands then give the fatal Blow;</l>
     <l n="183">For what at any other time would be</l>
     <l n="184">The dire Effect of Rage and Cruelty,</l>
     <l n="185">Is Mercy, Tenderness, and Pity now,</l>
     <l n="186">This then perform'd, we'll to the Battle fly,</l>
     <l n="187">And there amidst our slaughter'd Foes expire.</l>
     <l n="188">If 'tis Revenge and Glory you desire,</l>
     <l n="189">Now you may have them, if you dare but die;</l>
     <l n="190">Nay more, ev'n Freedom, and Eternity.</l>
