    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">, ye toyish Reeds, that once could please</l>
     <l n="2">My softer Lips, and lull my Cares to Ease;</l>
     <l n="3">Be gone; I'll waste no more vain Hours with you,</l>
     <l n="4">And smiling  too, Adieu,</l>
     <l n="5">A brighter Pow'r invokes my Muse,</l>
     <l n="6">And loftier Thoughts, and Raptures, does infuse,</l>
     <l n="7">See! beck'ning from yon Cloud,  stands,</l>
     <l n="8">And promises Assistance with his Hands,</l>
     <l n="9">I feel the heavy rolling ,</l>
     <l n="10">Incumbent, revel in his frail Abode,</l>
     <l n="11">How my Breast heaves, and Pulses beat!</l>
     <l n="12">I sink, I sink, beneath the furious Heat,</l>
     <l n="13">The weighty Bliss o'erwhelms my Breast,</l>
     <l n="14">And over-flowing Joys profusely waste;</l>
     <l n="15">Some nobler Bard, O , inspire,</l>
     <l n="16">Or Soul more large, th' Elapses to receive,</l>
     <l n="17">And, brighter yet, to catch the Fire,</l>
     <l n="18">And each gay following Charm, from Death, to save,</l>
     <l n="19">— In vain the Suit — the  inflames my Breast,</l>
     <l n="20">I rave, with Extasies opprest,</l>
     <l n="21">I rise, the Mountains lessen, and retire,</l>
     <l n="22">And now I mix, unsing'd, with Elemental Fire,</l>
     <l n="23">The  , I have in view,</l>
     <l n="24">Nor Mortal knows as yet, what Wonders will ensue;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="25">We pass'd thro' Regions of unsully'd Light,</l>
     <l n="26">I gaz'd, and sicken'd at the blissful Sight,</l>
     <l n="27">A shudd'ring Paleness seiz'd my Look,</l>
     <l n="28">At last the Pest Flew off, and thus I spoke;</l>
     <l n="29">"Say, , shall this bright Clime</l>
     <l n="30">"Survive the fatal Test of Time,</l>
     <l n="31">"Or perish, with our Mortal Globe below,</l>
     <l n="32">"When yon  no longer shines?</l>
     <l n="33">Straight I finisht, — veiling low;</l>
     <l n="34">The  rejoins,</l>
     <l n="35">"'Tis not for you, to ask, nor mine, to say,</l>
     <l n="36">"The Niceties of that ,</l>
     <l n="37">"Know, when o'erjaded time his Rounds has run,</l>
     <l n="38">"And finish'd are the radiant Journeys of the ,</l>
     <l n="39">"The great  shall rise,</l>
     <l n="40">"And Heaven's   appear in opening Skies,</l>
     <l n="41">"Eternal Grace, and Justice,  bestow</l>
     <l n="42">"On all the  below;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="43">He said; I mus'd, and thus return'd,</l>
     <l n="44">What Ensigns, courteous Stranger, tell,</l>
     <l n="45">Shall the brooding Day reveal?</l>
     <l n="46">He answer'd mild —</l>
     <l n="47">"Already, stupid with their Crimes,</l>
     <l n="48">"Blind Mortals, prostrate to their Idols, lie,</l>
     <l n="49">"Such were the boding times,</l>
     <l n="50">"E'er Ruin blasted from the Sluicy Sky,</l>
     <l n="51">"Dissolv'd they lay, in fulsom Ease,</l>
     <l n="52">"And revell'd in luxuriant Peace,</l>
     <l n="53">"In , they did their Hours consume,</l>
     <l n="54">"And  led on, their swift, advancing Doom;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="55">Adult'rate  already rise,</l>
     <l n="56">And dare to 'swage the angry Skies,</l>
     <l n="57">Erratick throngs, their  Blood deny,</l>
     <l n="58">And from the , alas!  does neglected sigh,</l>
     <l n="59">The  has rais'd his ,</l>
     <l n="60">And Ruin, only less than , Health, does spread,</l>
     <l n="61">So long the Gore thro' poison'd Veins has Flow'd,</l>
     <l n="62">That scarcely ranker is a Fury's Blood,</l>
     <l n="63">Yet specious Artifice, and fair Disguise,</l>
     <l n="64">The Monster's Shape, and curst Designs, belies,</l>
     <l n="65">A  black Venom, in an  Mien,</l>
     <l n="66">He quaffs, and scatters the contagious Spleen,</l>
     <l n="67">Straight, when  finishes his lawless Reign,</l>
     <l n="68">Nature shall paint the shining Scene,</l>
     <l n="69">Quick, as the Light'ning, which inspires the Train;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="70">Forward  shall provoke the Fray.</l>
     <l n="71">And , from her antient Order, stray,</l>
     <l n="72">Black tempests, gath'ring from the Seas around,</l>
     <l n="73">In horrid Ranges shall advance,</l>
     <l n="74">And as they march, in thickest Sables drown'd,</l>
     <l n="75">The Rival Thunder from the Clouds shall sound,</l>
     <l n="76">And Light'nings join the fearful Dance,</l>
     <l n="77">The blust'ring Armies o'er the Skies shall spread,</l>
     <l n="78">And universal terror shed,</l>
     <l n="79">Loud issuing Peals, and rising Sheets of Smoke.</l>
     <l n="80">Th' encumber'd Region of the Air shall choke,</l>
     <l n="81">The noisy Main shall lave the suff'ring Shore,</l>
     <l n="82">And from the Rocks the breaking Billows roar,</l>
     <l n="83">Black Thunder bursts, blue Light'ning burns,</l>
     <l n="84">And melting Worlds to Heaps of Ashes turns,</l>
     <l n="85">The Forests shall beneath the Tempest bend,</l>
     <l n="86">And rugged Winds the nodding  rend;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="87">Reverse, all Nature's Webb shall run,</l>
     <l n="88">And spotless  all around,</l>
     <l n="89">Order, its flying Foe, confound,</l>
     <l n="90">Whilst backward all the threads shall haste to be unspun,</l>
     <l n="91">Triumphant , with his oblique Wand,</l>
     <l n="92">(The Wand, with which, e'er time begun,</l>
     <l n="93">His wand'ring Slaves he did command,</l>
     <l n="94">And made 'em scamper right, and in rude Ranges run.)</l>
     <l n="95">The hostile Harmony, shall chace,</l>
     <l n="96">And as the Nymph resigns her place,</l>
     <l n="97">And panting to the neighb'ring Refuge, flies,</l>
     <l n="98">The formless Russian slaughters with his Eyes,</l>
     <l n="99">And following, storms the perching Dame's Retreat,</l>
     <l n="100">Adding the terror of his threat;</l>
     <l n="101">The Globe shall faintly tremble round,</l>
     <l n="102">And backward jolt, distorted with the wound;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="103">Swath'd in substantial Shrowds of Night,</l>
     <l n="104">The sick'ning , shall from the World retire,</l>
     <l n="105">Stript of his dazling Robes of Fire,</l>
     <l n="106">Which dangling once shed round a lavish Flood of Light</l>
     <l n="107">No frail Eclipse, but all Essential Shade,</l>
     <l n="108">Not yielding to Primæval Gloom,</l>
     <l n="109">Whilst Day was yet an  in the Womb,</l>
     <l n="110">Nor glimmering in it's Source, with Silver Streamers play'd.</l>
     <l n="111">A  Mixture of the Darkness, spread</l>
     <l n="112">O'er murmuring  Head,</l>
     <l n="113">And that, which Angels drew</l>
     <l n="114">O'er Nature's Face, when  dy'd,</l>
     <l n="115">Which sleeping Ghosts for this mistook,</l>
     <l n="116">And rising, off their hanging Funerals, shook,</l>
     <l n="117">And fleeting pass'd, expos'd their bloodless Breasts to View,</l>
     <l n="118">Yet find it not so dark, and to their Dormitories glide.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="119">Now bolder Fires appear,</l>
     <l n="120">And o'er the palpable Obscurement sport,</l>
     <l n="121">Glaring and gay as falling ,</l>
     <l n="122">Yet mark'd with Fate as when he Fled th' Etherial Court;</l>
     <l n="123">And plung'd into the op'ning Gulph of Night;</l>
     <l n="124">A Sabre of Immortal Flame I bore,</l>
     <l n="125">And, with this Arm, his Flour'shing Plume I tore,</l>
     <l n="126">And straight the Fiend retreated from the Fight.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="127">Mean time the lambent Prodigies on high,</l>
     <l n="128">Take gamesome Measures in the Sky,</l>
     <l n="129">Joy'd with his future Feast, the Thunder roars</l>
     <l n="130">In Chorus to th' enormous Harmony;</l>
     <l n="131">And hollows to his Off-spring from sulphurious Stores,</l>
     <l n="132">Applauding how they tilt, and how they fly,</l>
     <l n="133">And their each nimble Turn, and radiant Embassy.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="134">The  turns paler at the sight,</l>
     <l n="135">And all the  deny their Light;</l>
     <l n="136">The , with its livid Tail,</l>
     <l n="137">A Train of glitt'ring Terrors, draws behind,</l>
     <l n="138">Which o'er the trembling World prevail,</l>
     <l n="139">Wing'd, and blown on, by Storms of Wind,</l>
     <l n="140">They shew the hideous Leaps on either Hand</l>
     <l n="141">Of , that spreads her  round,</l>
     <l n="142">And there erects her royal Stand,</l>
     <l n="143">In seven-fold winding , her conscious temples bound.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="144">The , next, starting from their Sphere,</l>
     <l n="145">In giddy Revolutions leap and bound,</l>
     <l n="146">Whilst  with double Fury glares,</l>
     <l n="147">And meditates new Wars,</l>
     <l n="148">And wheels in sportive Gyres around,</l>
     <l n="149">It's Neighbour shall advance to fight,</l>
     <l n="150">And while each offers to enlarge its Right,</l>
     <l n="151">The general Ruin shall increase,</l>
     <l n="152">And banish all the Votaries of Peace;</l>
     <l n="153">No more the , with paler Beams,</l>
     <l n="154">Shall tremble o'er the Midnight Streams,</l>
     <l n="155">But travel downward to behold,</l>
     <l n="156">What mimicks 'em, so twink'ling There,</l>
     <l n="157">And, like , as they gain more near,</l>
     <l n="158">For the , straight expire,</l>
     <l n="159">And agonize in warm Desire,</l>
     <l n="160">Or slake their Lust, as in the Stream they roll;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="161">Whilst the World burns, and all the Orbs below,</l>
     <l n="162">In their viperous Ruins glow,</l>
     <l n="163">They sink, and unsupported leave the Skies,</l>
     <l n="164">Which fall abrupt, and tell their torment in the Noise,</l>
     <l n="165">Then see th'  , sedate, and bright,</l>
     <l n="166">Cloath'd in Imperial Robes of Light,</l>
     <l n="167">His Wings the Winds, rough Storms the Chariot bear,</l>
     <l n="168">And nimbler Harbingers before him Fly,</l>
     <l n="169">And with officious Rudeness brush the Air,</l>
     <l n="170">Halt as he halts, then doubling in their Flight,</l>
     <l n="171">In horrid Sport, with one another vie,</l>
     <l n="172">And leave behind quick-winding tracts of Light;</l>
     <l n="173">Then urging, to their Ranks they close,</l>
     <l n="174">And shiv'ring lest they start, a  compose.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="175">The   rides in tempestuous State,</l>
     <l n="176">Whilst menial Guards of Flame his Orders wait,</l>
     <l n="177">His waving Vestments shine,</l>
     <l n="178">Bright as the , which lately did its Beams resign,</l>
     <l n="179">And burnish'd Wreaths of Light shall make his Form Divine,</l>
     <l n="180">Strong Beams of Majesty around his temples play,</l>
     <l n="181">And the transcendent Gaity of his Face allay,</l>
     <l n="182">His  reverend Characters he'll wear,</l>
     <l n="183">And both o'erwhelm with Light, and over awe with Fear;</l>
     <l n="184">Myriads of Angels shall be there,</l>
     <l n="185">And I, perhaps, close the tremendous Rear;</l>
     <l n="186">Angels, the first and fairest Sons of Day,</l>
     <l n="187">Clad with eternal Youth, and, as their Vestments, gay;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="188">Nor, for Magnificence alone,</l>
     <l n="189">To brighten and enlarge the Pageant Scene,</l>
     <l n="190">Shall we encircle his more dazling throne,</l>
     <l n="191">And swell the Lustre of his pompous train,</l>
     <l n="192">The nimble Ministers of Bliss or Woe,</l>
     <l n="193">We shall attend, and save, or deal the Blow,</l>
     <l n="194">As  admits to Joy, or bids to Pain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="195">The welcome News,</l>
     <l n="196">Thro' ev'ry Angel's Breast, fresh Raptures shall diffuse,</l>
     <l n="197">The Day is come,</l>
     <l n="198">When , with his Pow'rs, shall sink to endless Doom,</l>
     <l n="199">No more shall we his hostile troops pursue,</l>
     <l n="200">From Cloud to Cloud, nor the long Fight renew;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16">
     <l n="201">Then , big with Life, the Trump shall sound;</l>
     <l n="202">From falling Spheres, the joyful Musick shall rebound,</l>
     <l n="203">And Seas and Shores shall catch, and propagate it round,</l>
     <l n="204">Louder he'll blow, and it shall speak more shrill,</l>
     <l n="205">Than when, from  Hill,</l>
     <l n="206">In Thunder, thro' the horrid redd'ning Smoke,</l>
     <l n="207">Th'  spoke;</l>
     <l n="208">We'll shout around with Martial Joy</l>
     <l n="209">And thrice the vaulted Skies shall rend, and thrice our Shouts reply,</l>
     <l n="210">Then first th'  Voice, aloud,</l>
     <l n="211">Shall chearfully salute the Day, and Throng,</l>
     <l n="212">And  fill the Crowd,</l>
     <l n="213">And I, perhaps, shall close the Song.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17">
     <l n="214">From it's long Sleep, all Human Race shall rise,</l>
     <l n="215">And see the , and  advancing in the Skies,</l>
     <l n="216">To their Old Tenements, the  return,</l>
     <l n="217">Whilst down the Steep of Heav'n, as swift, the  descends,</l>
     <l n="218">These look illustrious bright, no more to mourn,</l>
     <l n="219">Whilst, see! distracted Looks yon stalking Shade attend,</l>
     <l n="220">The  no more shall conflict on the Deep,</l>
     <l n="221">Nor rugged Waves insult the lab'ring Ship,</l>
     <l n="222">But from the Wreck in Triumph they ,</l>
     <l n="223">And borne to , shall tread .</l>
