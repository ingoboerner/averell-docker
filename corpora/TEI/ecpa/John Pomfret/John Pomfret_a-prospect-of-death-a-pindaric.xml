    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">we can die but once, and after Death</l>
     <l n="2">Our State no alteration knows;</l>
     <l n="3">But, when we have resign'd our Breath,</l>
     <l n="4">Th' immortal Spirit goes</l>
     <l n="5">To endless Joys, or everlasting Woes.</l>
     <l n="6">Wise is the Man who labours to secure</l>
     <l n="7">That mighty and important Stake;</l>
     <l n="8">And, by all methods, strives to make</l>
     <l n="9">His passage safe, and his reception sure.</l>
     <l n="10">Merely to die no Man of Reason fears,</l>
     <l n="11">For certainly we must,</l>
     <l n="12">As we are born, return to Dust:</l>
     <l n="13">'Tis the last Point of many lingering Years.</l>
     <l n="14">But whither then we go,</l>
     <l n="15">Whither, we fain would know;</l>
     <l n="16">But human Understanding cannot show,</l>
     <l n="17">This makes us tremble, and creates</l>
     <l n="18">Strange apprehensions in the Mind;</l>
     <l n="19">Fills it with restless Doubts, and wild Debates</l>
     <l n="20">Concerning what, we living, cannot find.</l>
     <l n="21">None know what Death is, but the Dead,</l>
     <l n="22">Therefore we all by Nature, Dying dread,</l>
     <l n="23">As a strange, doubtful way, we know not how to tread.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="24">When to the Margin of the Grave we come,</l>
     <l n="25">And scarce have one black painful hour to live.</l>
     <l n="26">No hopes, no prospect of a kind Reprieve,</l>
     <l n="27">To stop our speedy passage to the Tomb.</l>
     <l n="28">How moving, and how mournful is the sight,</l>
     <l n="29">How wond'rous pitiful, how wond'rous sad;</l>
     <l n="30">Where then is Refuge, where is Comfort to be had,</l>
     <l n="31">In the dark Minutes of the dreadful Night,</l>
     <l n="32">To chear our drooping Souls for their amazing Flight?</l>
     <l n="33">Feeble and languishing in Bed we lie,</l>
     <l n="34">Despairing to recover, void of rest,</l>
     <l n="35">Wishing for Death, and yet afraid to die:</l>
     <l n="36">Terrors and Doubts distract our Breast,</l>
     <l n="37">With mighty Agonies, and mighty Pains opprest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="38">Our Face is moisten'd with a clammy Sweat;</l>
     <l n="39">Faint and irregular the Pulses beat;</l>
     <l n="40">The Blood unactive grows,</l>
     <l n="41">And thickens as it flows,</l>
     <l n="42">Depriv'd of all its Vigour, all its vital Heat.</l>
     <l n="43">Our dying Eyes rowl heavily about,</l>
     <l n="44">Their Light just going out;</l>
     <l n="45">And for some kind assistance call,</l>
     <l n="46">But pity, useless pity's all</l>
     <l n="47">Our weeping Friends can give,</l>
     <l n="48">Or we receive;</l>
     <l n="49">Tho' their Desires are great, their Pow'rs are smal.</l>
     <l n="50">The Tongue's unable to declare</l>
     <l n="51">The Pains, the Griefs, the Miseries we bear;</l>
     <l n="52">How insupportable our Torments are.</l>
     <l n="53">Musick no more delights our deaf'ning Ears,</l>
     <l n="54">Restores our Joys, or dissipates our Fears;</l>
     <l n="55">But all is melancholy, all is sad,</l>
     <l n="56">In Robes of deepest Mourning clad:</l>
     <l n="57">For ev'ry Faculty, and ev'ry Sense,</l>
     <l n="58">Partakes the Woe of this dire Exigence.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="59">Then we are sensible, too late,</l>
     <l n="60">'Tis no advantage to be Rich or Great:</l>
     <l n="61">For all the fulsom Pride, and Pageantry of State,</l>
     <l n="62">No Consolation brings.</l>
     <l n="63">Riches and Honours, then are useless things,</l>
     <l n="64">Tasteless, or bitter all;</l>
     <l n="65">And, like the Book which the Apostle eat,</l>
     <l n="66">To the ill-judging Palate sweet,</l>
     <l n="67">But turn at last to Nauseousness and Gall.</l>
     <l n="68">Nothing will then our drooping Spirits chear,</l>
     <l n="69">But the remembrance of good Actions past.</l>
     <l n="70">Virtue's a Joy that will for ever last,</l>
     <l n="71">And makes pale Death less terrible appear;</l>
     <l n="72">Takes out his baneful Sting, and palliates our Fear.</l>
     <l n="73">In the dark Anti-Chamber of the Grave</l>
     <l n="74">What wou'd we give, ev'n all we have,</l>
     <l n="75">All that our Cares, and Industry had gain'd,</l>
     <l n="76">All that our Fraud, our Policy, our Art obtain'd,</l>
     <l n="77">Cou'd we recal those fatal Hours again,</l>
     <l n="78">Which we consum'd in sensless Vanities,</l>
     <l n="79">Ambitious Follies, and Luxurious Ease;</l>
     <l n="80">For then they urge our Terrors, and increase our Pain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="81">Our Friends and Relatives stand weeping by,</l>
     <l n="82">Dissolv'd in Tears to see us die;</l>
     <l n="83">And plunge into the deep Abyss of wide Eternity.</l>
     <l n="84">In vain they mourn, in vain they grieve,</l>
     <l n="85">Their Sorrows cannot ours relieve.</l>
     <l n="86">They pity our deplorable Estate,</l>
     <l n="87">But what, alas can pity do,</l>
     <l n="88">To soften the decrees of Fate!</l>
     <l n="89">Besides, the Sentence is irrevocable too.</l>
     <l n="90">All their endeavours to preserve our Breath,</l>
     <l n="91">Tho' they do unsuccessful prove,</l>
     <l n="92">Show us how much how tenderly they love,</l>
     <l n="93">But cannot cut off the entail of Death.</l>
     <l n="94">Mournful they look, and crowd about our Bed,</l>
     <l n="95">One with officious haste,</l>
     <l n="96">Brings us a Cordial, we want Sense to taste:</l>
     <l n="97">Another softly raises up our Head;</l>
     <l n="98">This wipes away the Sweat, that, sighing cries,</l>
     <l n="99">See what Convulsions, what strong Agonies,</l>
     <l n="100">Both Soul and Body undergo!</l>
     <l n="101">His Pains no intermission know;</l>
     <l n="102">For ev'ry gasp of Air he draws, returns in Sighs.</l>
     <l n="103">Each would his kind assistance lend</l>
     <l n="104">To serve his dear Relation, or his dearer Friend;</l>
     <l n="105">But still in vain, with Destiny they all contend.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="106">Our Father, pale with grief and watching grown,</l>
     <l n="107">Takes our cold Hand in his, and cries Adieu,</l>
     <l n="108">Adieu, my Child, now I must follow you.</l>
     <l n="109">Then weeps, and gently lays it down,</l>
     <l n="110">Our Sons, who in their tender Years,</l>
     <l n="111">Were Objects of our Cares, and of our Fears;</l>
     <l n="112">Come trembling to our Bed, and kneeling cry,</l>
     <l n="113">Bless us, O Father! now before you die;</l>
     <l n="114">Bless us, and be you blest to all Eternity.</l>
     <l n="115">Our Friend, whom equal to our selves we love,</l>
     <l n="116">Compassionate and kind,</l>
     <l n="117">Cries, will you leave me here behind,</l>
     <l n="118">Without me fly, to the blest Seats above?</l>
     <l n="119">Without me, did I say, ah no!</l>
     <l n="120">Without thy Friend thou can'st not go:</l>
     <l n="121">For tho' thou leav'st me grov'ling here below,</l>
     <l n="122">My Soul with thee shall upward fly,</l>
     <l n="123">And bear thy Spirit company,</l>
     <l n="124">Thro' the bright Passage of the yielding Sky.</l>
     <l n="125">Ev'n Death that parts thee from thy self, shall be</l>
     <l n="126">Incapable to separate</l>
     <l n="127">(For 'tis not in the Power of Fate)</l>
     <l n="128">My Friend, my best, my dearest Friend, and me:</l>
     <l n="129">But since it must be so, farewel</l>
     <l n="130">For ever! No; for we shall meet agen,</l>
     <l n="131">And live like Gods, tho' now we die like Men,</l>
     <l n="132">In the eternal Regions, where just Spirits dwell.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="133">The Soul, unable longer to maintain</l>
     <l n="134">The fruitless and unequal Strife,</l>
     <l n="135">Finding her weak Endeavours vain,</l>
     <l n="136">To keep the Counterscarp of Life,</l>
     <l n="137">By slow degrees retires toward the Heart,</l>
     <l n="138">And fortifies that little Fort</l>
     <l n="139">With all the kind Artilleries of Art;</l>
     <l n="140">Botanick Legions guarding ev'ry Port.</l>
     <l n="141">But Death, whose Arms no Mortal can repel,</l>
     <l n="142">A formal Siege disdains to lay,</l>
     <l n="143">Summons his fierce Battalions to the Fray,</l>
     <l n="144">And in a minute storms the feeble Cittadel.</l>
     <l n="145">Sometimes we may capitulate, and he</l>
     <l n="146">Pretends to make a solid Peace,</l>
     <l n="147">But 'tis all Sham, all Artifice;</l>
     <l n="148">That we may negligent and careless be:</l>
     <l n="149">For if his Armies are withdrawn to day,</l>
     <l n="150">And we believe no Danger near,</l>
     <l n="151">But all is peaceable, and all is clear,</l>
     <l n="152">His Troops return some unsuspected way,</l>
     <l n="153">While in the soft Embrace of Sleep we lie,</l>
     <l n="154">The secret Murd'rers stab us, and we die.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="155">Since our first Parents-Fall,</l>
     <l n="156">Inevitable Death descends on all,</l>
     <l n="157">A Portion none of Human Race can miss,</l>
     <l n="158">But that which makes it sweet, or bitter, is,</l>
     <l n="159">The Fears of Misery, or certain Hopes of Bliss:</l>
     <l n="160">For when th' Impenitent and Wicked die,</l>
     <l n="161">Loaded with Crimes, and Infamy,</l>
     <l n="162">If any Sense at that sad time remains,</l>
     <l n="163">They feel amazing Terrors, mighty Pains.</l>
     <l n="164">The earnest of that vast stupendous woe,</l>
     <l n="165">Which they to all Eternity must undergo;</l>
     <l n="166">Confin'd in Hell with everlasting Chains.</l>
     <l n="167">Infernal Spirits hover in the Air,</l>
     <l n="168">Like rav'nous Wolves, to seize upon the prey,</l>
     <l n="169">And hurry the departed Souls away</l>
     <l n="170">To the dark Receptacles of Despair;</l>
     <l n="171">Where they must dwell till that tremendous Day,</l>
     <l n="172">When the loud Trump shall call them to appear</l>
     <l n="173">Before a Judge most terrible, and most severe,</l>
     <l n="174">By whose just Sentence they must go</l>
     <l n="175">To everlasting Pains, and endless woe.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="176">But the good Man, whose Soul is pure,</l>
     <l n="177">Unspotted, regular, and free</l>
     <l n="178">From all the ugly Stains of Lust, and Villainy</l>
     <l n="179">Of Mercy, and of Pardon sure;</l>
     <l n="180">Looks thro' the Darkness of the gloomy Night,</l>
     <l n="181">And sees the Dawning of a glorious Day;</l>
     <l n="182">Sees Crowds of Angels ready to convey</l>
     <l n="183">His Soul, whene'er she takes her flight,</l>
     <l n="184">To the surprizing Mansions of immortal Light.</l>
     <l n="185">Then the Celestial Guards around him stand,</l>
     <l n="186">Nor suffer the black Dæmons of the Air</l>
     <l n="187">T' oppose his Passage to the promis'd Land;</l>
     <l n="188">Or terrify his Thoughts with wild Despair,</l>
     <l n="189">But all is calm within, and all without is fair.</l>
     <l n="190">His Prayers, his Charity, his Virtues press.</l>
     <l n="191">To plead for Mercy, when he wants it most;</l>
     <l n="192">Not one of all the happy Number's lost;</l>
     <l n="193">And those bright Advocates ne'er want success.</l>
     <l n="194">But when the Soul's releas'd from dull Mortality,</l>
     <l n="195">She passes up in triumph thro' the Sky,</l>
     <l n="196">Where she's united to a glorious throng</l>
     <l n="197">Of Angels, who with a Celestial Song,</l>
     <l n="198">Congratulate her Conquest as she flies along.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="199">If therefore all must quit the Stage,</l>
     <l n="200">When or how soon we cannot know,</l>
     <l n="201">But late or early, we are sure to go;</l>
     <l n="202">In the fresh Bloom of Youth, or wither'd Age;</l>
     <l n="203">We cannot take too sedulous a Care,</l>
     <l n="204">In this important, grand Affair.</l>
     <l n="205">For as we die, we must remain,</l>
     <l n="206">Hereafter all our Hopes are vain,</l>
     <l n="207">To make our Peace with Heav'n, or to return again.</l>
     <l n="208">The Heathen, who no better understood</l>
     <l n="209">Than what the Light of Nature taught, declar'd</l>
     <l n="210">No future Misery cou'd be prepar'd,</l>
     <l n="211">For the sincere, the merciful, the good;</l>
     <l n="212">But, if there was a State of Rest,</l>
     <l n="213">They should with the same Happiness be blest,</l>
     <l n="214">As the immortal Gods, if Gods there were possest,</l>
     <l n="215">We have the promise of eternal truth,</l>
     <l n="216">Those who live well, and pious Paths pursue.</l>
     <l n="217">To Man, and to their Maker true,</l>
     <l n="218">Let 'em expire in Age, or Youth,</l>
     <l n="219">Can never miss</l>
     <l n="220">Their way, to everlasting Bliss:</l>
     <l n="221">But from a World of Misery and Care,</l>
     <l n="222">To Mansions of eternal Ease repair:</l>
     <l n="223">Where Joy in full Perfection flows,</l>
     <l n="224">And in an endless Circle move,</l>
     <l n="225">Thro' the vast round of Beatifick Love,</l>
     <l n="226">Which no Cessation knows.</l>
