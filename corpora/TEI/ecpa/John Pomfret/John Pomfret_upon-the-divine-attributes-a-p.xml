     <l n="1">sprung this glorious Frame, or when began</l>
     <l n="2">Things to Exist, they could not always be?</l>
     <l n="3">To what stupendous Energy</l>
     <l n="4">Shall we ascribe the Origin of Man?</l>
     <l n="5">That Cause, from whence all Beings else arose,</l>
     <l n="6">Must Self-existent be alone,</l>
     <l n="7">Intirely perfect, and but One:</l>
     <l n="8">Nor Equal, nor Superior knows;</l>
     <l n="9">Two firsts, in Reason, we can ne'er suppose.</l>
     <l n="10">If that, in false Opinion, we allow,</l>
     <l n="11">That once there absolutely Nothing was,</l>
     <l n="12">Then Nothing could Be now:</l>
     <l n="13">For by what Instrument, or how</l>
     <l n="14">Shall Non-Existence to Existence pass?</l>
     <l n="15">Thus Something must from Everlasting be,</l>
     <l n="16">Or Matter, or a Deity.</l>
     <l n="17">If Matter only uncreate we grant,</l>
     <l n="18">We shall Volition, Wit, and Reason want;</l>
     <l n="19">An Agent infinite, and Action free,</l>
     <l n="20">Whence does Volition, whence does Reason flow?</l>
     <l n="21">How came we to Reflect, Design, and Know?</l>
     <l n="22">This from a nobler Nature springs,</l>
     <l n="23">Distinct in Essence from Material Things;</l>
     <l n="24">For Thoughtless Matter cannot Thought bestow.</l>
     <l n="25">But if we own a God Supream,</l>
     <l n="26">And all Perfection's possible in him:</l>
     <l n="27">In him does boundless Excellence reside,</l>
     <l n="28">Power to Create, and Providence to Guide.</l>
     <l n="29">Unmade himself, could no Beginning have,</l>
     <l n="30">But to all Substance prime Existence gave;</l>
     <l n="31">Can, what he will Destroy, and what he pleases Save.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="32">The undesigning Hand of giddy Chance,</l>
     <l n="33">Could never fill with Globes of Light,</l>
     <l n="34">So beautiful, and so amazing Bright,</l>
     <l n="35">The lofty Concave of the vast Expanse;</l>
     <l n="36">These could proceed from no less Power than Infinite.</l>
     <l n="37">There's not one Atom of this wond'rous Frame,</l>
     <l n="38">Nor Essence Intellectual, but took</l>
     <l n="39">Existence, when the great Creator spoke,</l>
     <l n="40">And from the common Womb of empty Nothing came.</l>
     <l n="41">Let Substance be, He cry'd, and strait arose</l>
     <l n="42">Angelick, and Corporeal too,</l>
     <l n="43">All that Material Nature shows,</l>
     <l n="44">And what does Things Invisible compose,</l>
     <l n="45">At the same Instant sprung, and into Being flew.</l>
     <l n="46">Mount to the Convex of the highest Sphere,</l>
     <l n="47">Which draws a mighty Circle round</l>
     <l n="48">Th' interior Orbs, as their capacious Bound,</l>
     <l n="49">There Millions of new Miracles appear;</l>
     <l n="50">There dwell the eldest Sons of Power Immense,</l>
     <l n="51">Who first were to Perfection wrought,</l>
     <l n="52">First to compleat Existence brought,</l>
     <l n="53">To whom their Maker did dispense</l>
     <l n="54">The largest Portions of created Excellence.</l>
     <l n="55">Eternal now, not of Necessity,</l>
     <l n="56">As if they could not cease to be,</l>
     <l n="57">Or were from possible Destruction free.</l>
     <l n="58">But on the Will of God depend,</l>
     <l n="59">For that, which could begin, can end.</l>
     <l n="60">Who, when the lower Worlds were made,</l>
     <l n="61">Without the least Miscarriage, or Defect</l>
     <l n="62">By the Almighty Architect,</l>
     <l n="63">United Adoration paid,</l>
     <l n="64">And with Exstatick Gratitude his Laws obey'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="65">Philosophy of old, in vain essay'd</l>
     <l n="66">To tell us, how this mighty Frame</l>
     <l n="67">Into such beauteous Order came;</l>
     <l n="68">But by false Reasonings, false Foundations laid,</l>
     <l n="69">She labour'd hard, but still the more she wrought,</l>
     <l n="70">The more was wilder'd in the Maze of Thought.</l>
     <l n="71">Sometimes she fancy'd things to be</l>
     <l n="72">Coeval with the Deity,</l>
     <l n="73">And in the Form, which now they are</l>
     <l n="74">From everlasting Ages were.</l>
     <l n="75">Sometimes the casual Event</l>
     <l n="76">Of Atoms floating in a space Immense,</l>
     <l n="77">Void of all Wisdom, Rule, and Sense,</l>
     <l n="78">But, by a lucky Accident,</l>
     <l n="79">Tumbled into this Scheme of wond'rous Excellence.</l>
     <l n="80">'Twas an establish'd Article of old</l>
     <l n="81">Chief of the Philosophick Creed,</l>
     <l n="82">And does in Natural Productions hold,</l>
     <l n="83">That from meer Nothing, Nothing could proceed:</l>
     <l n="84">Material Substance never could have rose,</l>
     <l n="85">If some Existence had not been before,</l>
     <l n="86">In Wisdom Infinite, Immense in Power,</l>
     <l n="87">Whate'er is made, a Maker must suppose,</l>
     <l n="88">As an Effect, a Cause, that could produce it shows.</l>
     <l n="89">Nature and Art indeed have Bounds assign'd,</l>
     <l n="90">And only Form to Things, not Being, give,</l>
     <l n="91">That, from Omnipotence they must receive:</l>
     <l n="92">But the Eternal Self-existent Mind,</l>
     <l n="93">Can with a single  cause to be</l>
     <l n="94">All, that the wond'ring Eye surveys,</l>
     <l n="95">And all, it cannot see.</l>
     <l n="96">Nature may shape a beauteous Tree,</l>
     <l n="97">And Art a noble Palace raise,</l>
     <l n="98">But must not to Creative Power aspire;</l>
     <l n="99">That, their great God alone can claim,</l>
     <l n="100">As Pre-existing Substance doth require;</l>
     <l n="101">So where they Nothing find, can Nothing Frame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="102">Matter produc'd had still a Chaos been,</l>
     <l n="103">For Jarring Elements engag'd,</l>
     <l n="104">Eternal Battles would have wag'd,</l>
     <l n="105">And fill'd with endless Horror the tumultuous Scene;</l>
     <l n="106">If Wisdom Infinite, for less</l>
     <l n="107">Could not the vast prodigious Embrio wield,</l>
     <l n="108">Or Strength compleat to labouring Nature yield,</l>
     <l n="109">Had not with actual Address</l>
     <l n="110">Compos'd the bellowing Hurry, and establish'd Peace.</l>
     <l n="111">Whate'er this visible Creation shows</l>
     <l n="112">That's lovely, uniform, and bright.</l>
     <l n="113">That gilds the Morning, or adorns the Night,</l>
     <l n="114">To her its Eminence and Beauty owes.</l>
     <l n="115">By her all Creatures have their Ends assign'd,</l>
     <l n="116">Proportion'd to their Nature, and their Kind;</l>
     <l n="117">To which they steadily advance,</l>
     <l n="118">Mov'd by right-Reason's high Command,</l>
     <l n="119">Or guided by the secret Hand</l>
     <l n="120">Of real Instinct, not imaginary Chance.</l>
     <l n="121">Nothing, but Men, reject her sacred Rules,</l>
     <l n="122">Who from the End of their Creation fly,</l>
     <l n="123">And deviate into Misery;</l>
     <l n="124">As if the liberty to act like Fools</l>
     <l n="125">Were the chief Cause, that Heaven made 'em free.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="126">Bold is the Wretch, and blasphemous the Man,</l>
     <l n="127">Who, Finite, will attempt to Scan</l>
     <l n="128">The Works of Him that's infinitely Wise,</l>
     <l n="129">And those he cannot Comprehend, denies;</l>
     <l n="130">As if a space Immense were measurable by a Span.</l>
     <l n="131">Thus the proud Sceptick will not own</l>
     <l n="132">That Providence the World directs,</l>
     <l n="133">Or its Affair inspects,</l>
     <l n="134">But leaves it to it self alone.</l>
     <l n="135">How does it with Almighty Grandeur suit,</l>
     <l n="136">To be concern'd with our Impertinence;</l>
     <l n="137">Or interpose his Power for the Defence</l>
     <l n="138">Of a poor Mortal, or a senseless Brute?</l>
     <l n="139">Villains could never so successful prove,</l>
     <l n="140">And unmolested in those Pleasures live,</l>
     <l n="141">Which Honour, Ease, and Affluence give:</l>
     <l n="142">While such as Heaven adore, and Virtue love,</l>
     <l n="143">And most the care of Providence deserve,</l>
     <l n="144">Oppress'd with Pain, and Ignominy starve.</l>
     <l n="145">What Reason can the wisest show,</l>
     <l n="146">Why Murder does unpunish'd go?</l>
     <l n="147">If the most High, that's Just and Good,</l>
     <l n="148">Intends and governs all below;</l>
     <l n="149">And yet regards not the loud Cries of guiltless Blood.</l>
     <l n="150">But shall we things unsearchable deny,</l>
     <l n="151">Because our Reason cannot tell us why</l>
     <l n="152">They are allow'd or acted by the Deity?</l>
     <l n="153">'Tis equally above the reach of Thought</l>
     <l n="154">To comprehend, how Matter should be brought</l>
     <l n="155">From Nothing, as Existent be</l>
     <l n="156">From all Eternity.</l>
     <l n="157">And yet that Matter is, we feel and see,</l>
     <l n="158">Nor is it easier to define</l>
     <l n="159">What Ligatures the Soul and Body join:</l>
     <l n="160">Or how the Mem'ry does th' Impression take</l>
     <l n="161">Of Things, and to the Mind restores 'em back.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="162">Did not th' Almighty, with immediate Care,</l>
     <l n="163">Direct and govern this capacious All,</l>
     <l n="164">How soon would things into Confusion fall;</l>
     <l n="165">Earthquakes the trembling Ground would tear,</l>
     <l n="166">And blazing Comets rule the troubled Air.</l>
     <l n="167">Wide Inundations with resistless force</l>
     <l n="168">The lower Provinces o'erflow,</l>
     <l n="169">In spight of all that Human Strength could do,</l>
     <l n="170">To stop a raging Sea's impetuous Course:</l>
     <l n="171">Murder and Rapine ev'ry place would fill,</l>
     <l n="172">And sinking Virtue stoop to prosp'rous Ill.</l>
     <l n="173">Devouring Pestilences rave,</l>
     <l n="174">And all that part of Nature which has Breath,</l>
     <l n="175">Deliver to the Tyranny of Death,</l>
     <l n="176">And hurry to the Dungeons of the Grave,</l>
     <l n="177">If watchful Providence were not concern'd to save.</l>
     <l n="178">Let the brave Soldier speak, who oft has been</l>
     <l n="179">In dreadful Sieges, and fierce Battles seen;</l>
     <l n="180">How he's preserv'd, when Bombs, and Bullets fly</l>
     <l n="181">So thick, that scarce one Inch of Air is free;</l>
     <l n="182">And tho' he does ten Thousand see</l>
     <l n="183">Fall at his Feet, and in a Moment die,</l>
     <l n="184">Unhurt retreats, or gains unhurt the Victory.</l>
     <l n="185">Let the poor Ship-wreck'd Sailor show,</l>
     <l n="186">To what invisible protecting Power</l>
     <l n="187">He did his Life and Safety owe,</l>
     <l n="188">When the loud Storm his well-built Vessel tore,</l>
     <l n="189">And half a shatter'd Plank convey'd him to the Shore.</l>
     <l n="190">Nay, let th' ungrateful Sceptick tell us, how</l>
     <l n="191">His tender Infancy protection found,</l>
     <l n="192">And helpless Childhood was with safety crown'd,</l>
     <l n="193">If he'll no Providence allow?</l>
     <l n="194">When he had nothing but his Nurse's Arms</l>
     <l n="195">To guard him from innumerable fatal Harms.</l>
     <l n="196">From Childhood, how to Youth he ran</l>
     <l n="197">Securely, and from thence to Man?</l>
     <l n="198">How in the Strength and Vigour of his Years,</l>
     <l n="199">The feeble Bark of Life he saves,</l>
     <l n="200">Amidst the Fury of tempestuous Waves,</l>
     <l n="201">From all the Dangers he foresees, or fears;</l>
     <l n="202">Yet ev'ry Hour 'twixt  and  steers;</l>
     <l n="203">If Providence, which can the Seas command,</l>
     <l n="204">Held not the Rudder with a steady Hand?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="205">'Tis happy for the Sons of Men, that He,</l>
     <l n="206">Who all Existence out of nothing made,</l>
     <l n="207">Supports his Creatures by immediate Aid;</l>
     <l n="208">But then this All-intending Deity</l>
     <l n="209">Must Omnipresent be.</l>
     <l n="210">For how shall we, by Demonstration, show</l>
     <l n="211">The Godhead is this Moment here,</l>
     <l n="212">If he's not present ev'ry where;</l>
     <l n="213">And always so?</l>
     <l n="214">What's not perceptable by Sense, may be</l>
     <l n="215">Ten thousand Miles remote from me,</l>
     <l n="216">Unless his Nature is from Limitation free.</l>
     <l n="217">In vain we for Protection pray;</l>
     <l n="218">For Benefits receiv'd high Altars raise,</l>
     <l n="219">And offer up our Hymns and Praise;</l>
     <l n="220">In vain his Anger dread, or Laws obey.</l>
     <l n="221">An absent God from Ruin can defend</l>
     <l n="222">No more, than can an absent Friend;</l>
     <l n="223">No more is capable to know</l>
     <l n="224">How gratefully we make returns,</l>
     <l n="225">When the loud Musick sounds, and Victim burns,</l>
     <l n="226">Than a poor  Slave of .</l>
     <l n="227">If so, 'tis equally in vain,</l>
     <l n="228">The Prosp'rous sings, and Wretched mourns;</l>
     <l n="229">He cannot hear the Praise, or mitigate the Pain.</l>
     <l n="230">But by what Being is confin'd</l>
     <l n="231">The God-head we adore?</l>
     <l n="232">He must have equal, or superior Power:</l>
     <l n="233">If equal only, they each other bind;</l>
     <l n="234">So neither's God if we define him right,</l>
     <l n="235">For neither's Infinite:</l>
     <l n="236">But if the other have superior Might,</l>
     <l n="237">Then him, we worship, can't pretend to be</l>
     <l n="238">Omnipotent, and free</l>
     <l n="239">From all Restraint, and so no Deity.</l>
     <l n="240">If God is limited in Space, his View,</l>
     <l n="241">His Knowledge, Power, and Wisdom is so too:</l>
     <l n="242">Unless we'll own that these Perfections are</l>
     <l n="243">At all times present ev'ry where;</l>
     <l n="244">Yet he himself not actually there.</l>
     <l n="245">Which to suppose, this strange Conclusion brings,</l>
     <l n="246">His Essence, and his Attributes are diff'rent things.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="247">As the Supream Omniscient Mind</l>
     <l n="248">Is by no Boundaries confin'd,</l>
     <l n="249">So Reason must acknowledge him to be</l>
     <l n="250">From possible Mutation free;</l>
     <l n="251">For what He is, he was from all Eternity.</l>
     <l n="252">Change, whether the Effect of Force, or Will,</l>
     <l n="253">Must argue Imperfection still.</l>
     <l n="254">But Imperfection in a Deity</l>
     <l n="255">That's absolutely perfect, cannot be:</l>
     <l n="256">Who can compel, without his own consent,</l>
     <l n="257">A God to Change, that is Omnipotent?</l>
     <l n="258">And ev'ry Alteration without Force,</l>
     <l n="259">Is for the better, or the worse:</l>
     <l n="260">He that is infinitely Wise,</l>
     <l n="261">To alter for the worse will never chuse,</l>
     <l n="262">That, a Depravity of Nature shews;</l>
     <l n="263">And he, in whom all true Perfection lies,</l>
     <l n="264">Cannot by Change to greater Excellencies rise.</l>
     <l n="265">If God be mutable; which way, or how</l>
     <l n="266">Shall we demonstrate, that will please him now,</l>
     <l n="267">Which did a thousand Years ago?</l>
     <l n="268">And 'tis impossible to know</l>
     <l n="269">What he forbids, or what he will allow.</l>
     <l n="270">Murder, Inchantment, Lust, and Perjury,</l>
     <l n="271">Did in the foremost Rank of Vices stand,</l>
     <l n="272">Prohibited by an express Command;</l>
     <l n="273">But whether such they still remain to be,</l>
     <l n="274">No Argument will positively prove,</l>
     <l n="275">Without immediate Notice from above;</l>
     <l n="276">If the Almighty Legislator can</l>
     <l n="277">Be chang'd, like his inconstant Subject, Man</l>
     <l n="278">Uncertain thus what to perform, or shun,</l>
     <l n="279">We all intolerable Hazards run,</l>
     <l n="280">When an eternal Stake is to be lost, or won.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="281">Rejoice, ye Sons of Piety, and sing</l>
     <l n="282">Loud Hallelujahs to his glorious Name,</l>
     <l n="283">Who was, and will for ever be the same:</l>
     <l n="284">Your grateful Incense to his Temples bring,</l>
     <l n="285">That from the smoaking Altars may arise</l>
     <l n="286">Clouds of Perfumes to the imperial Skies.</l>
     <l n="287">His Promises stand firm to you,</l>
     <l n="288">And endless Joys will be bestow'd,</l>
     <l n="289">As sure, as that there is a God,</l>
     <l n="290">On all who Virtue chuse, and righteous Paths pursue.</l>
     <l n="291">Nor should we more his Menaces distrust,</l>
     <l n="292">For while he is a Deity, he must</l>
     <l n="293">(As infinitely good) be infinitely just.</l>
     <l n="294">But does it with a gracious Godhead suit,</l>
     <l n="295">Whose Mercy is his Darling Attribute,</l>
     <l n="296">To punish Crimes, that temporary be,</l>
     <l n="297">And those but trivial Offences too,</l>
     <l n="298">Mere slips of human Nature, small and few,</l>
     <l n="299">With everlasting Misery?</l>
     <l n="300">This shocks the Mind, with deep Reflections fraught,</l>
     <l n="301">And Reason bends beneath the pond'rous Thought.</l>
     <l n="302">Crimes take their estimate from Guilt, and grow</l>
     <l n="303">More heinous still, the more they do incense</l>
     <l n="304">That God, to whom all Creatures owe</l>
     <l n="305">Profoundest Reverence.</l>
     <l n="306">Tho' as to that degree, they raise</l>
     <l n="307">The Anger of the Merciful most High,</l>
     <l n="308">We have no standard to discern it by,</l>
     <l n="309">But the Infliction, he, on the Offender lays.</l>
     <l n="310">So that if endless Punishment on all</l>
     <l n="311">Our unrepented Sins must fall,</l>
     <l n="312">None, not the least, can be accounted small.</l>
     <l n="313">That God, is in Perfection just, must be</l>
     <l n="314">Allow'd by all, that own a Deity:</l>
     <l n="315">If so, from Equity he cannot swerve,</l>
     <l n="316">Nor punish Sinners, more than they deserve.</l>
     <l n="317">His Will reveal'd, is both express and clear,</l>
     <l n="318">"Ye Cursed of my Father, go</l>
     <l n="319">"To everlasting Woe;</l>
     <l n="320">If Everlasting means Eternal here,</l>
     <l n="321">Duration absolutely without end,</l>
     <l n="322">Against which Sense some zealously contend,</l>
     <l n="323">That when apply'd to Pains, it only means,</l>
     <l n="324">They shall ten Thousand Ages last,</l>
     <l n="325">Ten Thousand more, perhaps, when they are past.</l>
     <l n="326">But not Eternal in a Literal Sense;</l>
     <l n="327">Yet own the Pleasures of the Just remain,</l>
     <l n="328">So long as there's a God exists to Reign.</l>
     <l n="329">Tho' none can give a solid Reason, why</l>
     <l n="330">The Word Eternity,</l>
     <l n="331">To Heav'n and Hell indifferently join'd,</l>
     <l n="332">Should carry Senses of a different kind;</l>
     <l n="333">And 'tis a sad Experiment to try.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="334">But if there be one Attribute Divine,</l>
     <l n="335">With greater Lustre than the rest can shine,</l>
     <l n="336">'Tis Goodness, which we ev'ry Moment see</l>
     <l n="337">The God-head exercise with such Delight,</l>
     <l n="338">It seems, it only seems, to be</l>
     <l n="339">The best belov'd Perfection of the Deity,</l>
     <l n="340">And more than Infinite.</l>
     <l n="341">Without that, he could never prove</l>
     <l n="342">A proper Object of our Praise or Love.</l>
     <l n="343">Were he not good, he'd be no more concern'd</l>
     <l n="344">To hear the Wretched in Affliction cry,</l>
     <l n="345">Or see the Guiltless for the Guilty die,</l>
     <l n="346">Than , when the flaming City burn'd,</l>
     <l n="347">And weeping  o'er its Ruins mourn'd.</l>
     <l n="348">Eternal Justice then would be</l>
     <l n="349">But everlasting Cruelty:</l>
     <l n="350">Power unrestrain'd, Almighty Violence,</l>
     <l n="351">And Wisdom unconfin'd, but Craft immense.</l>
     <l n="352">'Tis Goodness constitutes Him that He is,</l>
     <l n="353">And those</l>
     <l n="354">Who will deny him this,</l>
     <l n="355">A God without a Deity suppose.</l>
     <l n="356">When the lewd Atheist blasphemously swears</l>
     <l n="357">By his tremendous Name,</l>
     <l n="358">There is no God, but all's a Sham;</l>
     <l n="359">Insipid Tattle, Praise and Prayers:</l>
     <l n="360">Virtue, pretence; and all the sacred Rules</l>
     <l n="361">Religion teaches, Tricks to cully Fools;</l>
     <l n="362">Justice would strike th' audacious Villain dead,</l>
     <l n="363">But Mercy boundless saves his guilty Head;</l>
     <l n="364">Gives him Protection, and allows him Bread.</l>
     <l n="365">Does not the Sinner, whom no Danger awes,</l>
     <l n="366">Without Restraint his Infamy pursue,</l>
     <l n="367">Rejoice, and glory in it too;</l>
     <l n="368">Laugh at the Power Divine, and ridicule his Laws:</l>
     <l n="369">Labour in Vice, his Rivals to excel,</l>
     <l n="370">That when he's dead, they may their Pupils tell</l>
     <l n="371">How wittily the Fool was damn'd, how hard he fell.</l>
     <l n="372">Yet this vile Wretch in safety lives,</l>
     <l n="373">Blessings in common with the best receives,</l>
     <l n="374">Tho' he is proud t' affront the God those Blessings gives,</l>
     <l n="375">The chearful Sun his Influence sheds on all,</l>
     <l n="376">Has no respect to good or ill;</l>
     <l n="377">And fruitful Showers without distinction fall,</l>
     <l n="378">Which Fields with Corn, with Grass the Pastures fill,</l>
     <l n="379">The bounteous Hand of Heaven bestows</l>
     <l n="380">Success and Honour many times on those</l>
     <l n="381">Who scorn his Favourites, and caress his Foes.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="382">To this good God, whom my advent'rous Pen</l>
     <l n="383">Has dar'd to celebrate</l>
     <l n="384">In lofty  Strain;</l>
     <l n="385">Tho' with unequal strength to bear the weight</l>
     <l n="386">Of such a pond'rous Theme, so infinitely great:</l>
     <l n="387">To this good God, Celestial Spirits pay,</l>
     <l n="388">With Exstacy divine, incessant Praise,</l>
     <l n="389">While on the Glories of his Face they gaze,</l>
     <l n="390">In the bright Regions of eternal Day.</l>
     <l n="391">To him each rational Existence here,</l>
     <l n="392">Whose Breast one spark of Gratitude contains,</l>
     <l n="393">In whom there are the least remains</l>
     <l n="394">Of Piety or Fear,</l>
     <l n="395">His Tribute brings of joyful Sacrifice,</l>
     <l n="396">For Pardon prays, and for Protection flies,</l>
     <l n="397">Nay, the inanimate Creation give,</l>
     <l n="398">By prompt Obedience to his Word,</l>
     <l n="399">Instinctive Honour to their Lord;</l>
     <l n="400">And shame the thinking World, who in Rebellion live.</l>
     <l n="401">With Heaven and Earth then, O my Soul, unite,</l>
     <l n="402">And the great God of both, adore, and bless,</l>
     <l n="403">Who gives thee Competence, Content and Peace,</l>
     <l n="404">The only Fountains of sincere Delight.</l>
     <l n="405">That from the transitory Joys below,</l>
     <l n="406">Thou, by a happy Exit, may'st remove</l>
     <l n="407">To those ineffable, above:</l>
     <l n="408">Which from the Vision of the Godhead flow,</l>
     <l n="409">And neither End, Decrease, nor Interruption know.</l>
