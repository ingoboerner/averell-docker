    <lg n="1" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="1">YON coward, with the streaming hair,</l>
     <l n="2">And visage, madden'd to despair,</l>
     <l n="3">With step convuls'd, unsettled eye,</l>
     <l n="4">And bosom lab'ring with a sigh,</l>
     <l n="5">Is  â€” Behold, he hears the name,</l>
     <l n="6">And starts with horror, fear, and shame!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="quatrain">
     <l n="7">See! slow Suspicion by his side,</l>
     <l n="8">With winking, microscopic eye!</l>
     <l n="9">And Mystery, his muffled guide,</l>
     <l n="10">With fearful speech, and head awry.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="11">See! scowling Malice there attend,</l>
     <l n="12">Bold Falsehood, an apparent friend;</l>
     <l n="13">Avarice, repining o'er his pelf,</l>
     <l n="14">Mean Cunning, lover of himself;</l>
     <l n="15">Hatred, the son of conscious Fear,</l>
     <l n="16">Impatient Envy, with a fiendlike sneer,</l>
     <l n="17">And shades of blasted Hopes, which still are hovering near!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="18">All other woes will find relief,</l>
     <l n="19">And time alleviate every grief;</l>
     <l n="20">Memory, though slowly, will decay,</l>
     <l n="21">And Sorrow's empire pass away.</l>
     <l n="22">Awhile Misfortune may controul,</l>
     <l n="23">And Pain oppress the virtuous soul,</l>
     <l n="24">Yet Innocence can still beguile</l>
     <l n="25">The patient sufferer of a smile,</l>
     <l n="26">The beams of Hope may still dispense</l>
     <l n="27">A grateful feeling to the sense;</l>
     <l n="28">Friendship may cast her arms around,</l>
     <l n="29">And with fond tears embalm the wound,</l>
     <l n="30">Or Piety's soft incense rise,</l>
     <l n="31">And waft reflection to the skies;</l>
     <l n="32">But those fell pangs which he endures,</l>
     <l n="33">Nor Time forgets, nor Kindness cures;</l>
     <l n="34">Like Ocean's waves, they still return,</l>
     <l n="35">Like Etna's fires, forever burn.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="36">Round him no genial zephyrs fly,</l>
     <l n="37">No fair horizon glads his eye,</l>
     <l n="38">No joys to him does Nature yield,</l>
     <l n="39">The solemn grove, or laughing field;</l>
     <l n="40">Though both with loud rejoicings ring,</l>
     <l n="41">No pleasure does the echo bring.</l>
     <l n="42">Not bubbling waters as they roll,</l>
     <l n="43">Can tranquillize his bursting soul,</l>
     <l n="44">For Conscience still, with tingling smart,</l>
     <l n="45">Asserts his empire o'er his heart,</l>
     <l n="46">And even when his eye-lids close,</l>
     <l n="47">With clamourous scream affrights repose.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="48">Oppress'd with light, he seeks to shun</l>
     <l n="49">The splendid glories of the sun;</l>
     <l n="50">The busy crowds that hover near,</l>
     <l n="51">Torment his eye, distract his ear:</l>
     <l n="52">He hastens to the secret shades,</l>
     <l n="53">Where not a ray the gloom pervades;</l>
     <l n="54">Where Contemplation may retreat,</l>
     <l n="55">And Silence take his mossy seat:</l>
     <l n="56">Yet even there no peace he knows,</l>
     <l n="57">His fev'rish blood, no calmer flows;</l>
     <l n="58">Some hid assassins' vengeful knife,</l>
     <l n="59">Is rais'd to end his wretched life.</l>
     <l n="60">He shudders, starts, and stares around,</l>
     <l n="61">With breathless fright, to catch the fancied sound;</l>
     <l n="62">Seeks for the dagger in his breast,</l>
     <l n="63">And gripes it 'neath his ruffled vest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="64">Lo! now he plunges in the flood,</l>
     <l n="65">To cleanse his garments, stain'd with blood,</l>
     <l n="66">His sanguine arm, in terror, laves;</l>
     <l n="67">But ah! its hue defies the waves.</l>
     <l n="68">Deprest, bewilder'd, thence he flies,</l>
     <l n="69">And, to avoid Detection, tries,</l>
     <l n="70">Who, frowning, still before him stands,</l>
     <l n="71">The sword of Justice in her hands;</l>
     <l n="72">Abhorrent Scorn, unpitying Shame,</l>
     <l n="73">And Punishments without a name,</l>
     <l n="74">Still on her sounding steps attend,</l>
     <l n="75">And every added horror lend.</l>
     <l n="76">He turns away, with dread and fear,</l>
     <l n="77">But the fell spectres still are near.</l>
     <l n="78">Though Falsehood's mazes see him wind!</l>
     <l n="79">Yet Infamy is close behind,</l>
     <l n="80">Lifting her horn, with horrors fraught,</l>
     <l n="81">Whose hideous yell is frenzy to the thought.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="82">Now, maniac-like, he comes again,</l>
     <l n="83">And mixes with the jocund train;</l>
     <l n="84">But still those eyes that wildly roll,</l>
     <l n="85">Bespeak the tempest in his soul.</l>
     <l n="86">In yon deep cave he strives to rest,</l>
     <l n="87">But Mem'ry harrows up his breast;</l>
     <l n="88">He clasps the goblet, foe to Care,</l>
     <l n="89">And lo! Distraction hovers there.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="90">Ah, hapless wretch! condemn'd to know,</l>
     <l n="91">The sad varieties of woe;</l>
     <l n="92">Where'er thy footsteps turn, to meet,</l>
     <l n="93">An earthquake yawning at thy feet,</l>
     <l n="94">While o'er thy head pale meteors glare,</l>
     <l n="95">And boding tempests fill the air,</l>
     <l n="96">In throbbing anguish doom'd to roam,</l>
     <l n="97">Yet never find a peaceful home.</l>
     <l n="98">Haste! to the shrine of Mercy hie,</l>
     <l n="99">There lift the penitential eye,</l>
     <l n="100">With breaking heart thy sins deplore,</l>
     <l n="101">And wound Integrity no more!</l>
     <l n="102">Repentance then thy soul shall save,</l>
     <l n="103">And snatch thee, ransom'd, from the grave.</l>
