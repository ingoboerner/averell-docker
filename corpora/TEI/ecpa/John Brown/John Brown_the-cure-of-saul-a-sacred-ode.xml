    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">"VENGEANCE, arise from thy infernal bed;</l>
     <l n="2">" And pour thy tempest on his guilty head! "</l>
     <l n="3">Thus heaven's decree, in thunder's sound,</l>
     <l n="4">Shook the dark abyss profound. —</l>
     <l n="5">The unchain'd Furies come!</l>
     <l n="6">Pale Melancholy stalks from hell:</l>
     <l n="7">Th' abortive offspring of her womb,</l>
     <l n="8">Despair and Anguish, round her yell.</l>
     <l n="9">By sleepless terror Saul possess'd,</l>
     <l n="10">Deep feels the fiend within his tortur'd breast.</l>
     <l n="11">Midnight spectres round him howl:</l>
     <l n="12">Before his eyes</l>
     <l n="13">In troops they rise;</l>
     <l n="14">And seas of horror overwhelm his soul.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="15">Haste! to Jesse's son repair:</l>
     <l n="16">He best can sweep the lyre,</l>
     <l n="17">Wake the solemn-sounding air,</l>
     <l n="18">And lead the vocal choir:</l>
     <l n="19">On every string soft-breathing raptures dwell,</l>
     <l n="20">To sooth the throbbings of the troubled breast;</l>
     <l n="21">Whose magic voice can bid the tides of passion swell,</l>
     <l n="22">Or lull the raging storm to rest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="23">Sunk on his couch, and loathing day,</l>
     <l n="24">The heaven-forsaken monarch lay:</l>
     <l n="25">To the sad couch the shepherd now drew near;</l>
     <l n="26">And, while th' obedient choir stood round,</l>
     <l n="27">Prepar'd to catch the soul-commanding sound,</l>
     <l n="28">He dropp'd a generous tear. —</l>
     <l n="29">Thy pitying aid, O God, impart!</l>
     <l n="30">For lo, thy poison'd arrows drink his heart!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="31">The mighty song from chaos rose. —</l>
     <l n="32">Around his throne the formless atoms sleep,</l>
     <l n="33">And drowzy Darkness broods upon the deep. —</l>
     <l n="34">Confusion, wake!</l>
     <l n="35">Bid the realms of Chaos shake!</l>
     <l n="36">Rouse him from his dread repose!</l>
     <l n="37">Hark! loud Discord breaks her chain:</l>
     <l n="38">The hostile atoms clash with deafning roar:</l>
     <l n="39">Her hoarse voice thunders thro' the drear domain;</l>
     <l n="40">And kindles every element to war. —</l>
     <l n="41">"Tumult cease!</l>
     <l n="42">" Sink to peace!</l>
     <l n="43">"Let there be light!" — th' Almighty said:</l>
     <l n="44">And lo, the radiant Sun,</l>
     <l n="45">Flaming from his orient bed,</l>
     <l n="46">His endless course begun.</l>
     <l n="47">See, the twinkling Pleiads rise:</l>
     <l n="48">Thy star, Orion, reddens in the skies:</l>
     <l n="49">While slow around the northern plain,</l>
     <l n="50">Arcturus wheels his nightly wane.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="51">Thy glories, too, refulgent moon, he sung;</l>
     <l n="52">Thy mystic mazes, and thy changeful ray:</l>
     <l n="53">O fairest of the starry throng!</l>
     <l n="54">Thy solemn orb of light</l>
     <l n="55">Guides the triumphant carr of Night</l>
     <l n="56">O'er silver clouds, and sheds a softer day!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="57">Ye planets, and each circling constellation,</l>
     <l n="58">In songs harmonious tell your generation!</l>
     <l n="59">Oh, while yon radiant Seraph turns the spheres,</l>
     <l n="60">And on the stedfast pole-star stands sublime;</l>
     <l n="61">Wheel your rounds</l>
     <l n="62">To heavenly sounds;</l>
     <l n="63">And sooth his song-enchanted ears</l>
     <l n="64">With your celestial chime.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="65">In dumb surprize the listning monarch lay;</l>
     <l n="66">(His woe suspended by sweet Music's sway;)</l>
     <l n="67">And awe struck, with uplifted eye</l>
     <l n="68">Mus'd on the new-born wonders of the sky.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="69">Lead the soothing verse along:</l>
     <l n="70">He feels, he feels the power of song —</l>
     <l n="71">Ocean hastens to his bed:</l>
     <l n="72">The lab'ring mountain rears his rock-encumber'd head:</l>
     <l n="73">Down his steep and shaggy side</l>
     <l n="74">The torrent rolls his thundering tide;</l>
     <l n="75">Then smooth and clear, along the fertile plain</l>
     <l n="76">Winds his majestic waters to the distant main.</l>
     <l n="77">Flocks and herds the hills adorn:</l>
     <l n="78">The lark, high-soaring, hails the morn.</l>
     <l n="79">And while along yon crimson-clouded steep</l>
     <l n="80">The slow sun steals into the golden deep,</l>
     <l n="81">Hark! the solemn Nightingale</l>
     <l n="82">Warbles to the woodland dale.</l>
     <l n="83">See, descending angels shower</l>
     <l n="84">Heaven's own bliss on Eden's bower:</l>
     <l n="85">Peace on Nature's lap reposes;</l>
     <l n="86">Pleasure strews her guiltless roses:</l>
     <l n="87">Joys divine in circles move,</l>
     <l n="88">Link'd with Innocence and Love.</l>
     <l n="89">Hail, happy Love, with Innocence combin'd!</l>
     <l n="90">All hail, ye sinless parents of mankind!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="91">They paus'd: — the monarch, prostrate on his bed,</l>
     <l n="92">Submissive, bow'd his head;</l>
     <l n="93">Ador'd the works of boundless power divine:</l>
     <l n="94">Then, anguish-struck, he cry'd (an smote his breast),</l>
     <l n="95">Why, why is peace the welcome guest</l>
     <l n="96">Of every heart but mine!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="97">Now let the solemn numbers flow,</l>
     <l n="98">'Till he feel that guilt is woe.</l>
     <l n="99">Heavenly harp, in mournful strain</l>
     <l n="100">O'er yon weeping bower complain:</l>
     <l n="101">What sounds of bitter pangs I hear!</l>
     <l n="102">What lamentations wound mine ear!</l>
     <l n="103">In vain, devoted pair, these tears ye shed:</l>
     <l n="104">Peace with Innocence is fled.</l>
     <l n="105">The messengers of Grace depart:</l>
     <l n="106">Death glares, and shakes the dreadful dart!</l>
     <l n="107">Ah, whither fly ye, by yourselves abhorr'd,</l>
     <l n="108">To shun that frowning cherub's fiery sword? —</l>
     <l n="109">Lo!</l>
     <l n="110">Hapless, hapless pair,</l>
     <l n="111">Goaded by despair,</l>
     <l n="112">Forlorn, thro' desart climes they go!</l>
     <l n="113">Wake, my lyre! can Pity sleep,</l>
     <l n="114">When heaven is mov'd, and angels weep!</l>
     <l n="115">Flow, ye melting numbers, flow;</l>
     <l n="116">Till he feel, that guilt is woe. —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="117">The king, with pride, and shame, and anguish torn,</l>
     <l n="118">Shot fury from his eyes, and scorn.</l>
     <l n="119">The glowing youth,</l>
     <l n="120">Bold in truth,</l>
     <l n="121">(So still should Virtue guilty power engage)</l>
     <l n="122">With brow undaunted met his rage.</l>
     <l n="123">See, his cheek kindles into generous fire:</l>
     <l n="124">Stern, he bends him o'er his lyre;</l>
     <l n="125">And, while the doom of guilt he sings,</l>
     <l n="126">Shakes horror from the tortur'd strings.</l>
     <l n="127">What sounds of terror and distress</l>
     <l n="128">Rend yon howling wilderness!</l>
     <l n="129">The dreadful thunders sound;</l>
     <l n="130">The forked lightnings flash along the ground.</l>
     <l n="131">Why yawns that deep'ning gulph below? —</l>
     <l n="132">'Tis for heaven's rebellious foe: —</l>
     <l n="133">Fly, ye sons of Israel, fly,</l>
     <l n="134">Who dwells in Korah's guilty tents must die! —</l>
     <l n="135">They sink! — Have mercy, Lord! — Their cries</l>
     <l n="136">In dreadful tumult rise!</l>
     <l n="137">Hark, from the deep their loud laments I hear!</l>
     <l n="138">They lessen now, and lessen on the ear!</l>
     <l n="139">Now, destruction's strife is o'er!</l>
     <l n="140">The countless host</l>
     <l n="141">For ever lost!</l>
     <l n="142">The gulph is clos'd! — Their cries are heard no more! —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="143">But oh, my lyre, what accents can relate</l>
     <l n="144">Sinful man's appointed sate!</l>
     <l n="145">He comes, he comes! th' avenging God!</l>
     <l n="146">Clouds and darkness round him roll:</l>
     <l n="147">Tremble, earth! Ye mountains, nod!</l>
     <l n="148">He bows the skies, and shakes the pole.</l>
     <l n="149">The gloomy banners of his wrath unfurl'd,</l>
     <l n="150">He calls the floods, to drown a guilty world:</l>
     <l n="151">"Ruin, lift thy baleful head;</l>
     <l n="152">" Rouze the guilty world from sleep:</l>
     <l n="153">"Lead up thy billows from their cavern'd bed,</l>
     <l n="154">" And burst the rocks that chain thee in the deep. —</l>
     <l n="155">Now, th' impetuous torrents rise;</l>
     <l n="156">The hoarse-ascending deluge roars:</l>
     <l n="157">Down rush the cataracts from the skies;</l>
     <l n="158">The swelling waves o'erwhelm the shores.</l>
     <l n="159">Just, O God, is thy decree!</l>
     <l n="160">Shall guilty man contend with thee!</l>
     <l n="161">Lo, Hate and Envy, sea-entomb'd,</l>
     <l n="162">And Rage with Lust in ruin sleep;</l>
     <l n="163">And scoffing Luxury is doom'd</l>
     <l n="164">To glut the vast and ravenous deep! —</l>
     <l n="165">In vain from Fate th' astonish'd remnant flies: —</l>
     <l n="166">"Shrink, ye rocks! Ye oceans, rise!" —</l>
     <l n="167">The tottering cliffs no more the floods controul;</l>
     <l n="168">Sea following sea ingulphs the ball:</l>
     <l n="169">O'er the sunk hills the watry mountains roll,</l>
     <l n="170">And wide Destruction swallows all:</l>
     <l n="171">Now fiercer let th' impassion'd numbers glow:</l>
     <l n="172">Swell the song, ye mighty choir!</l>
     <l n="173">Wing your dreadful darts with fire!</l>
     <l n="174">Hear me, monarch! — Guilt is woe! —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="175">Thus while the frowning shepherd pour'd along</l>
     <l n="176">The deep impetuous torrent of his song;</l>
     <l n="177">Saul, stung by dire despair,</l>
     <l n="178">Gnash'd his teeth, and tore his hair:</l>
     <l n="179">From his blood, by horror chill'd,</l>
     <l n="180">A cold and agonizing sweat distill'd:</l>
     <l n="181">Then, foaming with unutterable smart.</l>
     <l n="182">He aim'd a dagger at his heart.</l>
     <l n="183">His watchful train prevent the blow;</l>
     <l n="184">And call each lenient balm to sooth his frantic woe:</l>
     <l n="185">But pleas'd, the shepherd now beheld</l>
     <l n="186">His pride by heaven's own terrors quell'd:</l>
     <l n="187">Then bade his potent lyre controul</l>
     <l n="188">The mighty storm that rent his soul.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="189">Cease your cares: the body's pain</l>
     <l n="190">A sweet relief may find:</l>
     <l n="191">But gums and lenient balms are vain,</l>
     <l n="192">To heal the wounded mind.</l>
     <l n="193">Come, fair Repentance, from the skies,</l>
     <l n="194">O sainted maid, with upcast eyes!</l>
     <l n="195">Descend, in thy celestial shrowd,</l>
     <l n="196">Vested in a weeping cloud!</l>
     <l n="197">Holy guide, descend, and bring</l>
     <l n="198">Mercy from th' Eternal King!</l>
     <l n="199">To his soul your beams impart,</l>
     <l n="200">And whisper comfort to his heart! —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="201">They come: O King, thine ear incline!</l>
     <l n="202">Listen to their voice divine:</l>
     <l n="203">Their voice shall every pang compose,</l>
     <l n="204">To gentle sorrow sooth thy woes;</l>
     <l n="205">Till each pure wish to heaven shall soar,</l>
     <l n="206">And Peace return, to part no more!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16">
     <l n="207">Behold, obedient to their great command,</l>
     <l n="208">The lifted dagger quits his trembling hand:</l>
     <l n="209">Smooth'd is his brow, where sullen Care</l>
     <l n="210">And furrow'd Horror couch'd with fell Despair:</l>
     <l n="211">No more his eyes with fury glow;</l>
     <l n="212">But heavenly grief succeeds to hell-born woe. —</l>
     <l n="213">See, the signs of grace appear:</l>
     <l n="214">See the soft relenting tear,</l>
     <l n="215">Trickling at sweet Mercy's call!</l>
     <l n="216">Catch it, angels, ere it fall!</l>
     <l n="217">And let the heart-sent offering rise,</l>
     <l n="218">Heaven's best-accepted sacrifice! —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17">
     <l n="219">Yet, yet again? — Ah see, the pang returns!</l>
     <l n="220">Again with inward fire his heaving bosom burns!</l>
     <l n="221">Now, shepherd, wake a mightier strain;</l>
     <l n="222">Search the deep, heart-rending pain;</l>
     <l n="223">Till the large floods of sorrow roll,</l>
     <l n="224">And quench the tortures of his soul.</l>
     <l n="225">Almighty Lord, accept his pang sincere!</l>
     <l n="226">Let heavenly hope dispel each dark temptation!</l>
     <l n="227">And, while he pours the penitential tear,</l>
     <l n="228">O visit him with thy salvation! —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18">
     <l n="229">Stoop from heaven, ye raptur'd throng!</l>
     <l n="230">Sink, ye swelling tides of song!</l>
     <l n="231">For lo! dissolv'd by Music's melting power,</l>
     <l n="232">Celestial Sorrow rolls her plenteous shower,</l>
     <l n="233">O'er his wan cheek the colours rise;</l>
     <l n="234">And beams of comfort brighten in his eyes.</l>
     <l n="235">Happy king, thy woes are o'er!</l>
     <l n="236">Thy God shall wound thy soul no more:</l>
     <l n="237">The pitying Father of mankind</l>
     <l n="238">Meets the pure-returning mind.</l>
     <l n="239">No more shall black Despair afflict his soul:</l>
     <l n="240">Each gentler sound, ye shepherds, now combine:</l>
     <l n="241">Sweetly let the numbers roll:</l>
     <l n="242">Sooth him into hope divine.</l>
     <l n="243">Now lowly let the rustic measure glide,</l>
     <l n="244">To quell the dark remains of self-consuming Pride;</l>
     <l n="245">Till Nature's home-sprung blessings he confess,</l>
     <l n="246">And own that calm content is happiness. —</l>
     <l n="247">Ye woods and lakes, ye cliffs and mountains!</l>
     <l n="248">Haunted grots, and living fountains!</l>
     <l n="249">Listen to your shepherd's lay,</l>
     <l n="250">Whose artless carols close the day.</l>
     <l n="251">Bounding kids around him throng;</l>
     <l n="252">The steep rock echoes back his song:</l>
     <l n="253">While all unseen to mortal eye,</l>
     <l n="254">Sliding down the evening sky,</l>
     <l n="255">Holy Peace, tho' born above,</l>
     <l n="256">Daughter of Innocence and Love,</l>
     <l n="257">Quits her throne and mansion bright,</l>
     <l n="258">Her crown of stars, and robe of light,</l>
     <l n="259">Serene, in gentle smiles array'd,</l>
     <l n="260">To dwell beneath his palm-tree shade.</l>
     <l n="261">Hail, meek angel! awful guest!</l>
     <l n="262">Still pour thy radiance o'er my breast!</l>
     <l n="263">Pride and Hate in courts may shine:</l>
     <l n="264">The shepherd's calm and blameless tent is thine! —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="19">
     <l n="265">Softly, softly breathe your numbers;</l>
     <l n="266">And wrap his weary'd soul in slumbers!</l>
     <l n="267">Gentle Sleep, becalm his breast,</l>
     <l n="268">And close his eyes in healing rest!</l>
     <l n="269">Descend, celestial visions, ye who wait,</l>
     <l n="270">God's ministring powers, at heaven's eternal gate!</l>
     <l n="271">Ye, who nightly vigils keep,</l>
     <l n="272">And rule the silent realms of Sleep,</l>
     <l n="273">Exalt the just to joys refin'd,</l>
     <l n="274">And plunge in woe the guilty mind;</l>
     <l n="275">Descend! — Oh, waft him to the skies,</l>
     <l n="276">And open all heaven's glories to his eyes!</l>
     <l n="277">Beyond yon starry roof, by seraphs trod,</l>
     <l n="278">Where Light's unclouded fountains blaze;</l>
     <l n="279">Where choirs immortal hymn their God,</l>
     <l n="280">Intranc'd in extasy of ceaseless praise.</l>
     <l n="281">Angels, heal his anguish!</l>
     <l n="282">Your harps and voices join!</l>
     <l n="283">His grief to bliss shall languish,</l>
     <l n="284">When sooth'd by sounds divine.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="20">
     <l n="285">Behold, with dawning joy each feature glows!</l>
     <l n="286">See, the blissful tear o'erflows! —</l>
     <l n="287">The fiend is fled! — Let music's rapture rise:</l>
     <l n="288">Now Harmony, thy every nerve employ:</l>
     <l n="289">Shake the dome, and pierce the skies:</l>
     <l n="290">Wake him, wake him into joy. —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="21">
     <l n="291">What power can every Passion's throne controul?</l>
     <l n="292">What power can boast the charm divine,</l>
     <l n="293">To still the tempest of the soul?</l>
     <l n="294">Celestial Harmony, that mighty charm is thine!</l>
     <l n="295">She, heavenly-born, came down to visit earth,</l>
     <l n="296">When from God's eternal throne</l>
     <l n="297">The beam of all-creative Wisdom shone,</l>
     <l n="298">And spake fair Order into birth.</l>
     <l n="299">At Wisdom's call she robed yon glittering skies,</l>
     <l n="300">Attun'd the spheres, and taught consenting orbs to rise.</l>
     <l n="301">Angels wrapt in wonder stood,</l>
     <l n="302">And saw that all was fair, and all was good.</l>
     <l n="303">'Twas then, ye sons of God, in bright array</l>
     <l n="304">Ye shouted o'er creation's day:</l>
     <l n="305">Then kindling into joy,</l>
     <l n="306">The morning stars together sung:</l>
     <l n="307">And thro' the vast ethereal sky</l>
     <l n="308">Seraphic hymns and loud hosannahs rung.</l>
