    <lg n="1" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="1">WHILE orient skies restore the day,</l>
     <l n="2">And dew-drops catch the lucid ray;</l>
     <l n="3">Amid the sprightly scenes of morn,</l>
     <l n="4">Will aught the Muse inspire?</l>
     <l n="5">Oh! peace to yonder clamorous horn</l>
     <l n="6">That drowns the sacred lyre!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="sestet">
     <l n="7">Ye rural  that o'er the mossy down</l>
     <l n="8">Some panting, timorous hare pursue;</l>
     <l n="9">Does nature mean your joys alone to crown?</l>
     <l n="10">Say, does she smoothe her lawns for you?</l>
     <l n="11">For you does Echo bid the rocks reply,</l>
     <l n="12">And urg'd by rude constraint resound the jovial cry?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="septet">
     <l n="13">See from the neighbouring hill, forlorn</l>
     <l n="14">The wretched swain your sport survey;</l>
     <l n="15">He finds his faithful fences torn,</l>
     <l n="16">He finds his labour'd crops a prey;</l>
     <l n="17">He sees his flock â€” no more in circles feed;</l>
     <l n="18">Haply beneath your ravage bleed,</l>
     <l n="19">And with no random curses loads the deed.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="20">Nor yet, ye  conclude</l>
     <l n="21">That Nature smiles for you alone;</l>
     <l n="22">Your bounded souls, and your conceptions crude,</l>
     <l n="23">The proud, the selfish boast disown:</l>
     <l n="24">Yours be the produce of the soil;</l>
     <l n="25">O may it still reward your toil!</l>
     <l n="26">Nor ever the defenceless train</l>
     <l n="27">Of clinging infants, ask support in vain!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="28">But tho' the various harvest gild your plains,</l>
     <l n="29">Does the mere landschape feast your eye?</l>
     <l n="30">Or the warm hope of distant gains</l>
     <l n="31">Far other cause of glee supply?</l>
     <l n="32">Is not the red-streak's future juice</l>
     <l n="33">The source of your delight profound,</l>
     <l n="34">Where Ariconium pours her gems profuse,</l>
     <l n="35">Purpling a whole horizon round?</l>
     <l n="36">Athirst ye praise the limpid stream, 'tis true:</l>
     <l n="37">But tho', the pebbled shores among,</l>
     <l n="38">It mimick no unpleasing song,</l>
     <l n="39">The limpid fountain  not for you.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="couplet">
     <l n="40">Unpleas'd ye see the thickets bloom,</l>
     <l n="41">Unpleas'd the Spring her  robe resume;</l>
     <l n="42">Unmov'd the mountain's airy pile,</l>
     <l n="43">The dappled mead without a smile.</l>
     <l n="44">O let a rural conscious Muse,</l>
     <l n="45">For well she knows, your froward sense accuse:</l>
     <l n="46">Forth to the solemn oak you bring the square,</l>
     <l n="47">And span the massy trunk, before you cry, 'tis fair.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="nine-line">
     <l n="48">Nor yet ye  not yet ye  train,</l>
     <l n="49">If haply from your haunts ye stray</l>
     <l n="50">To waste with us a summer's day,</l>
     <l n="51">Exclude the taste of  swain,</l>
     <l n="52">Nor our untutor'd sense disdain:</l>
     <l n="53">'Tis Nature only gives exclusive right</l>
     <l n="54">To relish her supreme delight;</l>
     <l n="55">She, where she pleases kind or coy,</l>
     <l n="56">Who furnishes the scene, and forms us to enjoy.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="57">Then higher bring the fair ingenuous mind,</l>
     <l n="58">By her auspicious aid refin'd;</l>
     <l n="59">Lo! not an hedge-row hawthorn blows,</l>
     <l n="60">Or humble hare-bell paints the plain,</l>
     <l n="61">Or valley winds, or fountain flows,</l>
     <l n="62">Or purple heath is ting'd in vain:</l>
     <l n="63">For such the rivers dash their foaming tides,</l>
     <l n="64">The mountain swells, the dale subsides;</l>
     <l n="65">Ev'n thriftless furze detains their wandering sight,</l>
     <l n="66">And the rough barren rock grows pregnant with delight.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="67">With what suspicious fearful care</l>
     <l n="68">The sordid wretch secures his claim,</l>
     <l n="69">If haply some luxurious heir</l>
     <l n="70">Should alienate the fields that wear his name!</l>
     <l n="71">What scruples lest some future birth</l>
     <l n="72">Should litigate a span of earth!</l>
     <l n="73">Bonds, contracts, feoffments, names unmeet for prose,</l>
     <l n="74">The towering Muse endures not to disclose;</l>
     <l n="75">Alas!  unrevers'd decree,</l>
     <l n="76">More comprehensive and more free,</l>
     <l n="77">Her lavish charter, Taste, appropriates all we see.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="78">Let gondolas their painted flags unfold,</l>
     <l n="79">And be the solemn day enroll'd,</l>
     <l n="80">When, to confirm his lofty plea,</l>
     <l n="81">In nuptial sort, with bridal gold,</l>
     <l n="82">The grave Venetian weds the sea:</l>
     <l n="83">Each laughing Muse derides the vow;</l>
     <l n="84">Ev'n Adria scorns the mock embrace,</l>
     <l n="85">To some lone  on the mountain's brow,</l>
     <l n="86">Allotted, from his natal hour,</l>
     <l n="87">With all her myrtle shores in dow'r.</l>
     <l n="88">His breast to admiration prone</l>
     <l n="89">Enjoys the smile upon her face,</l>
     <l n="90">Enjoys triumphant every grace,</l>
     <l n="91">And finds her more his own.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="92">Fatigu'd with form's oppressive laws,</l>
     <l n="93">When SOMERSET avoids the Great;</l>
     <l n="94">When cloy'd with merited applause,</l>
     <l n="95">She seeks the rural calm retreat;</l>
     <l n="96">Does she not praise each mossy cell,</l>
     <l n="97">And feel the truth my numbers tell?</l>
     <l n="98">When deafen'd by the loud acclaim,</l>
     <l n="99">Which genius grac'd with rank obtains,</l>
     <l n="100">Could she not more delighted hear</l>
     <l n="101">Yon throstle chaunt the rising year?</l>
     <l n="102">Could she not spurn the wreaths of fame,</l>
     <l n="103">To crop the primrose of the plains?</l>
     <l n="104">Does she not sweets in each fair valley find,</l>
     <l n="105">Lost to the sons of pow'r, unknown to half mankind?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="106">Ah can she covet there to see</l>
     <l n="107">The splendid slaves, the reptile race,</l>
     <l n="108">That oil the tongue, and bow the knee,</l>
     <l n="109">That slight her merit, but adore her place?</l>
     <l n="110">Far happier, if aright I deem,</l>
     <l n="111">When from gay throngs, and gilded spires,</l>
     <l n="112">To where the  halcyons play,</l>
     <l n="113">Her philosophick step retires:</l>
     <l n="114">While studious of the moral theme,</l>
     <l n="115">She, to some smooth sequester'd stream</l>
     <l n="116">Likens the swain's inglorious day;</l>
     <l n="117">Pleas'd from the flowery margin to survey,</l>
     <l n="118">How cool, serene, and clear the current glides away.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="119">O blind to truth, to virtue blind,</l>
     <l n="120">Who slight the sweetly-pensive mind!</l>
     <l n="121">On whose fair birth the Graces mild,</l>
     <l n="122">And every Muse prophetick smil'd.</l>
     <l n="123">Not that the poet's boasted fire</l>
     <l n="124">Should Fame's wide-echoing trumpet swell;</l>
     <l n="125">Or, on the musick of his lyre</l>
     <l n="126">Each future age with rapture dwell;</l>
     <l n="127">The vaunted sweet of praise remove,</l>
     <l n="128">Yet shall  bosoms claim a part</l>
     <l n="129">In all that glads the human heart;</l>
     <l n="130">Yet these the spirits, form'd to judge and prove</l>
     <l n="131">All nature's charms immense, and Heav'n's unbounded love.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="132">And oh! the transport, most ally'd to song,</l>
     <l n="133">In some fair villa's peaceful bound,</l>
     <l n="134">To catch soft hints from Nature's tongue,</l>
     <l n="135">And bid Arcadia bloom around:</l>
     <l n="136">Whether we fringe the sloping hill,</l>
     <l n="137">Or smoothe below the verdant mead;</l>
     <l n="138">Whether we break the falling rill,</l>
     <l n="139">Or thro' meandering mazes lead;</l>
     <l n="140">Or in the horrid bramble's room</l>
     <l n="141">Bid careless groups of roses bloom;</l>
     <l n="142">Or let some shelter'd lake serene</l>
     <l n="143">Reflect flow'rs, woods and spires, and brighten all the scene.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="144">O sweet disposal of the rural hour!</l>
     <l n="145">O beauties never known to cloy!</l>
     <l n="146">While worth and genius haunt the favour'd bow'r,</l>
     <l n="147">And every  breast partakes the joy!</l>
     <l n="148">While  at eve surveys the swain,</l>
     <l n="149">Enabled by these toils to chear</l>
     <l n="150">A train of helpless infants dear,</l>
     <l n="151">Speed whistling home across the plain;</l>
     <l n="152">Sees vagrant  her hand-maid grown,</l>
     <l n="153">For half her graceless deeds attone,</l>
     <l n="154">And hails the bounteous work, and ranks it with her own.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="155">Why brand these pleasures with the name</l>
     <l n="156">Of soft, unsocial toils, of indolence and shame?</l>
     <l n="157">Search but the garden, or the wood,</l>
     <l n="158">Let yon admir'd carnation own,</l>
     <l n="159">Not  was meant for raiment, or for food,</l>
     <l n="160">Not  for needful use alone;</l>
     <l n="161">There while the seed of future blossoms dwell,</l>
     <l n="162">'Tis colour'd for the sight, perfum'd to please the smell.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="17">
     <l n="163">Why knows the nightingale to sing?</l>
     <l n="164">Why flows the pine's nectareous juice?</l>
     <l n="165">Why shines with paint the linnet's wing?</l>
     <l n="166">For sustenance alone? for use?</l>
     <l n="167">For preservation? Every sphere</l>
     <l n="168">Shall bid fair  rightful claim appear.</l>
     <l n="169">And sure there seem, of  kind,</l>
     <l n="170">born to shun the solemn strife;</l>
     <l n="171">Some for  tasks design'd,</l>
     <l n="172">To soothe the certain ills of life;</l>
     <l n="173">Grace it's lone vales with many a budding rose,</l>
     <l n="174">New founts of bliss disclose,</l>
     <l n="175">Call forth refreshing shades, and decorate repose.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18">
     <l n="176">From plains and woodlands; from the view</l>
     <l n="177">Of rural Nature's blooming face,</l>
     <l n="178">Smit with the glare of rank and place,</l>
     <l n="179">To courts the sons of Fancy flew;</l>
     <l n="180">long had Art ordain'd a rival seat;</l>
     <l n="181">There had she lavish'd all her care</l>
     <l n="182">To form a scene more dazling fair,</l>
     <l n="183">And call'd them from their green retreat</l>
     <l n="184">To share her proud controul;</l>
     <l n="185">Had giv'n the robe with grace to flow,</l>
     <l n="186">Had taught exotick gems to flow;</l>
     <l n="187">And emulous of nature's pow'r,</l>
     <l n="188">Mimick'd the plume, the leaf, the flow'r;</l>
     <l n="189">Chang'd the complexion's native hue,</l>
     <l n="190">Moulded each rustick limb anew,</l>
     <l n="191">And warp'd the very soul!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="19">
     <l n="192">Awhile her magick strikes the novel eye,</l>
     <l n="193">Awhile the faery forms delight;</l>
     <l n="194">And now aloof we seem to fly</l>
     <l n="195">On purple pinions thro' a purer sky,</l>
     <l n="196">Where all is wonderous, all is bright:</l>
     <l n="197">Now landed on some spangled shore</l>
     <l n="198">Awhile each dazled maniac roves</l>
     <l n="199">By saphire lakes, thro' em'rald groves,</l>
     <l n="200">Paternal acres please no more;</l>
     <l n="201">Adieu the simple, the sincere delight â€”</l>
     <l n="202">Th' habitual scene of hill and dale,</l>
     <l n="203">The rural herds, the vernal gale,</l>
     <l n="204">The tangled vetch's purple bloom,</l>
     <l n="205">The fragrance of the bean's perfume,</l>
     <l n="206">Be theirs alone who cultivate the soil,</l>
     <l n="207">And drink the cup of thirst, and eat the bread of toil,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="20" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="208">But soon the pageant fades away!</l>
     <l n="209">'Tis  only bears perpetual sway.</l>
     <l n="210">We pierce the counterfeit delight,</l>
     <l n="211">Fatigu'd with splendour's irksome beams,</l>
     <l n="212">Fancy again demands the sight</l>
     <l n="213">Of native groves, and wonted streams,</l>
     <l n="214">Pants for the scenes that charm'd her youthful eyes,</l>
     <l n="215">Where Truth maintains her court, and banishes disguise.</l>

     <l n="216">Then hither oft ye senators retire,</l>

     <l n="241">Borne to the dusty town from native air,</l>

     <l n="288">Let no harsh dissonance disturb the morn,</l>
     <l n="289">No sounds inelegant and rude</l>
     <l n="290">Her sacred solitudes profane!</l>
     <l n="291">Unless her candour not exclude</l>
     <l n="292">The lowly shepherd's votive strain,</l>
     <l n="293">Who tunes his reed amist his rural chear,</l>
