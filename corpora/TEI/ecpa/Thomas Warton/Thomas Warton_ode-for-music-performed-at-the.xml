    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">WHERE shall the muse, that on the sacred shell</l>
     <l n="2">Of men in arts and arms renown'd</l>
     <l n="3">The solemn strain delights to swell;</l>
     <l n="4">O! where shall Clio chuse a race,</l>
     <l n="5">Whom fame with every laurel, every grace,</l>
     <l n="6">Like those of Albion's envied isle, has crown'd?</l>
     <l n="7">Daughter and mistress of the sea,</l>
     <l n="8">All-honour'd Albion, hail!</l>
     <l n="9">Where-e'er thy commerce spreads the swelling sail,</l>
     <l n="10">Ne'er shall she find a land like thee,</l>
     <l n="11">So brave, so learned, and so free;</l>
     <l n="12">All-honour'd Albion, hail!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="13">But in the princely land of all that's good and great,</l>
     <l n="14">Would Clio seek the most distinguish'd seat,</l>
     <l n="15">Most blest, where all is so sublimely blest,</l>
     <l n="16">That with superior grace o'erlooks the rest,</l>
     <l n="17">Like a rich gem in circling gold enshrin'd;</l>
     <l n="18">Where Isis' waters wind</l>
     <l n="19">Along the sweetest shore</l>
     <l n="20">That ever felt fair Culture's hands,</l>
     <l n="21">Or Spring's embroider'd mantle wore,</l>
     <l n="22">Lo! where majestic Oxford stands;</l>
     <l n="23">Virtue's awful throne!</l>
     <l n="24">Wisdom's immortal source!</l>
     <l n="25">Thee well her best belov'd may boasting Albion own,</l>
     <l n="26">Whence each fair purpose of ingenuous praise,</l>
     <l n="27">All that in thought or deed divine is deem'd,</l>
     <l n="28">In one unbounded tide, one unremitted course,</l>
     <l n="29">From age to age has still successive stream'd;</l>
     <l n="30">Where Learning and where Liberty have nurst,</l>
     <l n="31">For those that in their ranks have shone the first,</l>
     <l n="32">Their most luxuriant growth of ever-blooming bays.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="33">In ancient days, when she the queen endu'd</l>
     <l n="34">With more than female fortitude,</l>
     <l n="35">Bonduca led her painted ranks to fight;</l>
     <l n="36">Oft-times, in adamantine arms array'd,</l>
     <l n="37">Pallas descended from the realms of light,</l>
     <l n="38">Imperial Britonesse! thy kindred aid,</l>
     <l n="39">As once, all-glowing from the well-fought day,</l>
     <l n="40">The goddess sought a cooling stream,</l>
     <l n="41">By chance, inviting with their glassy gleam,</l>
     <l n="42">Fair Isis' waters flow'd not far away.</l>
     <l n="43">Eager she view'd the wave,</l>
     <l n="44">On the cool bank she bar'd her breast,</l>
     <l n="45">To the soft gale her locks ambrosial gave;</l>
     <l n="46">And thus the watry nymph addrest.</l>
     <l n="47">Hear, gentle nymph, whoe'er thou art,</l>
     <l n="48">Thy sweet refreshing stores impart:</l>
     <l n="49">A Goddess from thy mossy brink</l>
     <l n="50">Asks of thy crystal stream to drink:</l>
     <l n="51">Lo! Pallas asks the friendly gift;</l>
     <l n="52">Thy coral crowned tresses lift,</l>
     <l n="53">Rise from the wave, propitious power,</l>
     <l n="54">O listen from thy pearly bower!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="55">Her accents Isis' calm attention caught,</l>
     <l n="56">As lonesome, in her secret cell,</l>
     <l n="57">In ever-varying hues, as mimic fancy taught,</l>
     <l n="58">She rang'd the many-tinctur'd shell:</l>
     <l n="59">Then from her work arose the Nais mild;</l>
     <l n="60">She rose, and sweetly smil'd</l>
     <l n="61">With many a lovely look,</l>
     <l n="62">That whisper'd soft consent:</l>
     <l n="63">She smil'd, and gave the Goddess in her flood</l>
     <l n="64">To dip her casque, tho' dy'd in recent blood;</l>
     <l n="65">While Pallas, as the boon she took,</l>
     <l n="66">Thus pour'd the grateful sentiment.</l>
     <l n="67">For this, thy flood the fairest name</l>
     <l n="68">Of all Britannia's streams shall glide,</l>
     <l n="69">Best favourite of the sons of fame,</l>
     <l n="70">Of every tuneful breast the pride:</l>
     <l n="71">For on thy borders, bounteous queen,</l>
     <l n="72">Where now the cowslip paints the green</l>
     <l n="73">With unregarded grace,</l>
     <l n="74">Her wanton herds where nature feeds,</l>
     <l n="75">As lonesome o'er the breezy reeds</l>
     <l n="76">She bends her silent pace;</l>
     <l n="77">Lo! there, to wisdom's goddess dear,</l>
     <l n="78">A far-fam'd city shall her turrets rear,</l>
     <l n="79">There all her force shall Pallas prove;</l>
     <l n="80">Of classic leaf with every crown,</l>
     <l n="81">Each olive, meed of old renown,</l>
     <l n="82">Each ancient wreath, which Athens wove,</l>
     <l n="83">I'll bid her blooming bowers abound;</l>
     <l n="84">And Oxford's sacred seats shall tower</l>
     <l n="85">To thee, mild Nais of the flood,</l>
     <l n="86">The trophy of my gratitude!</l>
     <l n="87">The temple of my power!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="88">Nor was the pious promise vain;</l>
     <l n="89">Soon illustrious Alfred came,</l>
     <l n="90">And pitch'd fair Wisdom's tent on Isis' plenteous plain.</l>
     <l n="91">Alfred, on thee shall all the muses wait,</l>
     <l n="92">Alfred, majestic name!</l>
     <l n="93">Of all our praise the spring!</l>
     <l n="94">Thee all thy suns shall sing,</l>
     <l n="95">Deck'd with the marshal and the civic wreath;</l>
     <l n="96">In notes most awful shall the trumpet breathe</l>
     <l n="97">To thee, great Romulus of Learning's richest stare.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="98">Nor Alfred's bounteous hand alone,</l>
     <l n="99">Oxford, thy rising temples own:</l>
     <l n="100">Soon many a man munificent,</l>
     <l n="101">The prince, the prelate, laurel-crown'd crowd,</l>
     <l n="102">Their ample bounty lent</l>
     <l n="103">To build the beauteous monument,</l>
     <l n="104">That Pallas vow'd.</l>
     <l n="105">And now she lifts her head sublime</l>
     <l n="106">Majestic in the moss of time;</l>
     <l n="107">Nor wants there Grecia's better part.</l>
     <l n="108">'Mid the proud piles of antient art,</l>
     <l n="109">Whose fretted spires, with ruder hand,</l>
     <l n="110">Wainfleet and Wickham bravely plann'd;</l>
     <l n="111">Nor decent Doric to dispense</l>
     <l n="112">New charms 'mid old magnificence;</l>
     <l n="113">And here and there soft Corinth weares</l>
     <l n="114">Her daedal coronet of leaves;</l>
     <l n="115">While, as with rival pride their towers invade the sky,</l>
     <l n="116">Radcliffe and Bodley seem to rye,</l>
     <l n="117">Which shall deserve the foremost place,</l>
     <l n="118">Or Gothic strength, or Attic grace.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="119">O Isis! ever will I chant thy praise:</l>
     <l n="120">Not that thy sons have struck the golden lyre</l>
     <l n="121">With hands most skilful; have their brows entwin'd</l>
     <l n="122">With every fairest flower of Helicon,</l>
     <l n="123">The sweetest swans of all th' harmonious choir;</l>
     <l n="124">Have bad the musing mind</l>
     <l n="125">Of every science pierce the pathless ways,</l>
     <l n="126">And from the rest the wreath of wisdom won;</l>
     <l n="127">But that thy sons have dar'd to feel</l>
     <l n="128">For Freedom's cause a sacred zeal;</l>
     <l n="129">With British breast, and patriot pride,</l>
     <l n="130">Have still Corruption's cup defy'd;</l>
     <l n="131">In dangerous days untaught to fear,</l>
     <l n="132">Have held the name of honour dear.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="133">But chief of this illustrious day,</l>
     <l n="134">The Muse her loudest Paeans loves to pay.</l>
     <l n="135">Ere while she strove with accents weak</l>
     <l n="136">In vain to build the lofty rhyme;</l>
     <l n="137">At length, by better days of bounty chear'd,</l>
     <l n="138">She dares unfold her wing.</l>
     <l n="139">Hail hour of transport most sublime!</l>
     <l n="140">In which, the man rever'd</l>
     <l n="141">Immortal Crew commands to sing,</l>
     <l n="142">And gives the pipe to breathe, the string to speak.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="143">Blest prelate, hail!</l>
     <l n="144">Most pious patron, most triumphant theme!</l>
     <l n="145">From whose auspicious hand</l>
     <l n="146">On Isis' towers new beauties beam,</l>
     <l n="147">New praise her nursing fathers gain;</l>
     <l n="148">Immortal Crew!</l>
     <l n="149">Blest prelate, hail!</l>
     <l n="150">Ev'n now fir'd Fancy sees thee lead</l>
     <l n="151">To Fame's high-seated fane</l>
     <l n="152">The shouting band!</l>
     <l n="153">O'er every hallowed head</l>
     <l n="154">Fame's choicest wreaths she sees thee spread:</l>
     <l n="155">Alfred superior smiles the solemn scene to view;</l>
     <l n="156">And bids the Goddess lift</l>
     <l n="157">Her loudest trumpet to proclaim,</l>
     <l n="158">O Crew! thy consecrated gift,</l>
     <l n="159">And echo with his own in social strains thy name.</l>
