    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">COME, musing Silence, nor refuse to shed</l>
     <l n="2">Thy sober influence o'er this darkling cell;</l>
     <l n="3">Thy desart waste and lonely plain,</l>
     <l n="4">Could ne'er confine thy peaceful reign;</l>
     <l n="5">Nor dost thou only love to dwell</l>
     <l n="6">Mid the dark mansions of the vaulted dead:</l>
     <l n="7">For still at eve's serenest hour,</l>
     <l n="8">All Nature owns thy soothing pow'r:</l>
     <l n="9">Oft hast thou deign'd with me to rove,</l>
     <l n="10">Beneath the calm sequester'd grove;</l>
     <l n="11">Oft deign'd my secret steps to lead</l>
     <l n="12">Along the dewy pathless mead;</l>
     <l n="13">Or up the dusky lawn, to spy</l>
     <l n="14">The last faint gleamings of the twilight sky.</l>
     <l n="15">Then wilt thou still thy pensive vot'ry meet,</l>
     <l n="16">Oft as he calls thee to this gloomy seat:</l>
     <l n="17">For here, with many a solemn mystic rite,</l>
     <l n="18">Wert thou invok'd to consecrate the ground,</l>
     <l n="19">Ere these rude walls were rear'd remote from sight,</l>
     <l n="20">Or ere with moss this shaggy roof was crown'd</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="21">Hail! blessed parent of each purer thought,</l>
     <l n="22">That doth at once the heart exalt and mend!</l>
     <l n="23">Here wilt thou never fail to find</l>
     <l n="24">My vacant solitude inclin'd</l>
     <l n="25">Thy serious lessons to attend.</l>
     <l n="26">For they I ween shall be with goodness fraught,</l>
     <l n="27">Whether thou bid me meditate</l>
     <l n="28">On man, in untaught nature's state;</l>
     <l n="29">How far this life he ought to prize;</l>
     <l n="30">How far its transient scenes despise:</l>
     <l n="31">What heights his reason may attain,</l>
     <l n="32">And where its proud attempts are vain:</l>
     <l n="33">What toils his virtue ought to brave,</l>
     <l n="34">For Hope's rewarding joys beyond the grave:</l>
     <l n="35">Or if in man redeem'd you bid me trace</l>
     <l n="36">Each wond'rous proof of heav'n's transcendent grace;</l>
     <l n="37">Then breathe some sparks of that celestial fire,</l>
     <l n="38">Which in the raptur'd seraph glows above,</l>
     <l n="39">Where sainted myriads crowd the joyful choir,</l>
     <l n="40">And harp their praises round the throne of love.</l>
     <l n="41">The trifling sons of Levity and Pride</l>
     <l n="42">Hence shall thy aweful seriousness exclude;</l>
     <l n="43">Nor shall loud Riot's thoughtless train</l>
     <l n="44">With frantic mirth this grott profane.</l>
     <l n="45">No foe to peace shall here intrude.</l>
     <l n="46">For thou wilt kindly bid each sound subside,</l>
     <l n="47">Save such as soothes the list'ning sense,</l>
     <l n="48">And serves to aid thy influence:</l>
     <l n="49">Save where, soft-breathing o'er the plain,</l>
     <l n="50">Mild Zephyr waves the rustling grain:</l>
     <l n="51">Or where some stream, from rocky source,</l>
     <l n="52">Slow trickles down its ceaseless course:</l>
     <l n="53">Or where the sea's imperfect roar</l>
     <l n="54">Comes gently murm'ring from the distant shore.</l>
     <l n="55">But most in Philomel, sweet bird of night,</l>
     <l n="56">In plaintive Philomel, is thy delight:</l>
     <l n="57">For she, or studious to prolong her grief,</l>
     <l n="58">Or oft to vary her exhaustless lay,</l>
     <l n="59">With frequent pause, from thee shall seek relief,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor close her strain, till dawns the noisy day.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="61">Without thy aid, to happier tasteful art,</l>
     <l n="62">No deep instructive science could prevail:</l>
     <l n="63">For only where thou dost preside,</l>
     <l n="64">Can wit's inventive pow'rs be tried:</l>
     <l n="65">And reason's better task would fail,</l>
     <l n="66">Did not thy haunts the serious theme impart.</l>
     <l n="67">The critic, that with plodding head</l>
     <l n="68">Toils o'er the learning of the dead;</l>
     <l n="69">The cloister'd hermit that explores,</l>
     <l n="70">By midnight lamp, religion's stores;</l>
     <l n="71">Each sage that marks, with thoughtful gaze,</l>
     <l n="72">The lunar orb, or planet's maze;</l>
     <l n="73">And ev'ry bard, that strays along</l>
     <l n="74">The sylvan shade, intent on sacred song;</l>
     <l n="75">Shall all to thee those various praises give,</l>
     <l n="76">Which, through thy friendly aid, themselves receive:</l>
     <l n="77">For tho' thou mayst from glory's seats retire,</l>
     <l n="78">Where loud applause proclaims the honour'd name;</l>
     <l n="79">Yet doth thy modest wisdom still inspire</l>
     <l n="80">Each nobler work that swells the voice of Fame.</l>
