     <l n="1">WHAT luckless freight or sorrow dost thou bring,</l>
     <l n="2">From that fair isle for health and pleasure fam'd.</l>
     <l n="3">What Sirock blast! with feverish vapours fell?</l>
     <l n="4">Relentless fate! is this his wish'd return?</l>
     <l n="5">Less cruel Scylla and Charybdian gulph,</l>
     <l n="6">That spar'd the vessel from Messinian shore,</l>
     <l n="7">That bears his last remains.</l>
     <l n="8">Far from his kindred and his native home,</l>
     <l n="9">Scarce one lov'd friend to close his pallid eye,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor wedded spouse; nor sons, were by.</l>
     <l n="11">Where were ye, Muses, and Sicilian nymphs,</l>
     <l n="12">To lead him safe through all thy flow'ry vales?</l>
     <l n="13">By sacred fountain and poetic hill,</l>
     <l n="14">To waft him health amidst thy fragrant groves.</l>
     <l n="15">Ah! what avails the curious restless mind?</l>
     <l n="16">Fraught with the beauties of each classic scene.</l>
     <l n="17">Shun the enchanted isle,</l>
     <l n="18">Nor listen to the tale.</l>
     <l n="19">In liquid flames let Etna's thunder roar;</l>
     <l n="20">Far distant from thy shore</l>
     <l n="21">Let British sails be seen;</l>
     <l n="22">Nor one advent'rous son the airy summit try,</l>
     <l n="23">That looks tremendous to a world below. —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="24">Join in the solemn song,</l>
     <l n="25">And as you move along,</l>
     <l n="26">Strew flow'rets on his bier;</l>
     <l n="27">In soft and mournful air,</l>
     <l n="28">In funeral pomp be seen,</l>
     <l n="29">Each nymph in cypress green;</l>
     <l n="30">These duties to the dead,</l>
     <l n="31">When in the tomb art laid.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="32">Hail! all the ancient fathers of the name,</l>
     <l n="33">Too soon thou'rt gone to them.</l>
     <l n="34">In long resounding airs</l>
     <l n="35">Let honour fill the lays,</l>
     <l n="36">And give what friendship feels,</l>
     <l n="37">To truth and worth like his.</l>
     <l n="38">Thus to the hallow'd isle</l>
     <l n="39">Give all that earth can claim;</l>
     <l n="40">In happier summits while</l>
     <l n="41">His spirit roams above,</l>
     <l n="42">And, rapt amidst the sky,</l>
     <l n="43">Sees thousand worlds below,</l>
     <l n="44">Or with enlighten'd eye</l>
     <l n="45">Takes in unbounded space.</l>
