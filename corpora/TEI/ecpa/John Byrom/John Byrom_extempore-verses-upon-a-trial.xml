    <lg n="1" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="1" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">LONG was the great Figg, by the prize-fighting swains,</l>
     <l n="2" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Sole monarch acknowledg'd of Mary-bone plains:</l>
     <l n="3" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To the towns, far and near, did his valour extend,</l>
     <l n="4" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And swam down the river from Thame to Gravesend;</l>
     <l n="5" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Where liv'd Mr. Sutton, pipemaker by trade,</l>
     <l n="6" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Who hearing that Figg was thought such a stout blade,</l>
     <l n="7" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame,</l>
     <l n="8" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And so sent to challenge the champion of Thame.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="9" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With alternate advantage two trials had past,</l>
     <l n="10" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">When they fought out the rubbers on Wednesday last.</l>
     <l n="11" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To see such a contest the house was so full</l>
     <l n="12" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">There hardly was room left to thrust in your skull.</l>
     <l n="13" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With a prelude of cudgells we first were saluted,</l>
     <l n="14" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted;</l>
     <l n="15" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Till weary at last with inferior disasters,</l>
     <l n="16" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">All the company cry'd, come, the masters, the masters.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="17" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Whereupon the bold Sutton first mounted the stage,</l>
     <l n="18" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Made his honours as usual, and yearn'd to engage;</l>
     <l n="19" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then Figg, with a visage so fierce, yet sedate,</l>
     <l n="20" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Came, and enter'd the lists, with his fresh-shaven pate;</l>
     <l n="21" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Their arms were encircled with armigers too,</l>
     <l n="22" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With a red ribbon Sutton's, and Figg's with a blue.</l>
     <l n="23" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Thus adorn'd the two heroes, 'twixt shoulder, and elbow,</l>
     <l n="24" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Shook hands, and went to 't, and the word it was Bilboe.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="25" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators,</l>
     <l n="26" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Was never yet seen in our amphi-theatres.</l>
     <l n="27" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Our commons and peers from their several places,</l>
     <l n="28" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To half an inch distance all pointed their faces;</l>
     <l n="29" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">the rays of old Phoebus, that shot thro' the sky-light,</l>
     <l n="30" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight;</l>
     <l n="31" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And the Gods without doubt, if one cou'd but have seen 'em,</l>
     <l n="32" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Were peeping there thro' to do justice between 'em.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="33" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Figg struck the first stroke, and with such a vast fury,</l>
     <l n="34" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That he broke his huge weapon in twain, I assure you;</l>
     <l n="35" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And if his brave rival this blow had not warded,</l>
     <l n="36" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">His head from his shoulders had quite been discarded.</l>
     <l n="37" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Figg arm'd him again, and they took t' other tilt,</l>
     <l n="38" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And then Sutton's blade ran away from its hilt;</l>
     <l n="39" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The weapons were frighted, but as for the men,</l>
     <l n="40" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In truth they ne'er minded, but at it again.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="41" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Such a force in their blows, you'd have thought it a wonder</l>
     <l n="42" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Every stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder.</l>
     <l n="43" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Yet so great was their courage, so equal their skill,</l>
     <l n="44" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill;</l>
     <l n="45" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">While in doubtful attention dame Victory stood,</l>
     <l n="46" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And which side to take cou'd not tell for her blood,</l>
     <l n="47" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But remain'd like the ass, 'twixt the bundles of hay,</l>
     <l n="48" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Without ever stirring an inch either way.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="49" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Till Jove to the Gods signified his intention</l>
     <l n="50" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">In a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention;</l>
     <l n="51" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But the upshot on 't was, that at that very bout,</l>
     <l n="52" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">From a wound in Figg's side the hot blood spouted out;</l>
     <l n="53" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain,</l>
     <l n="54" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But Figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain,</l>
     <l n="55" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Shew'd the gash, and appeal'd to the company round,</l>
     <l n="56" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">If his own broken sword had not given him the wound.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="57" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That bruises, and wounds a man's spirit shou'd touch,</l>
     <l n="58" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">With danger so little, with honour so much!</l>
     <l n="59" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Well, they both took a dram, and return'd to the battle,</l>
     <l n="60" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle;</l>
     <l n="61" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">While Sutton's right arm was observed to bleed,</l>
     <l n="62" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">By a touch from his rival; so Jove had decreed;</l>
     <l n="63" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Just enough for to shew that his blood was not icor,</l>
     <l n="64" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But made up, like Figg's, of the common red-liquor.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="65" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on,</l>
     <l n="66" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Till the company cry'd, hold, enough of cold iron,</l>
     <l n="67" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">To the quarter-staff now, lads. So first having dram'd it,</l>
     <l n="68" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">They took to their woods, and i' faith never sham'd it.</l>
     <l n="69" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">The first bout they had was so fair, and so handsome,</l>
     <l n="70" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That to make a fair bargain, was worth a king's ransom;</l>
     <l n="71" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And Sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted,</l>
     <l n="72" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Wou'd have made any fibres but Figg's to have smarted.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10" stanza_type="octet">
     <l n="73" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Then after that bout they went on to another â€”</l>
     <l n="74" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">But the matter must end on some fashion, or other;</l>
     <l n="75" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">So Jove told the Gods he hath made a decree,</l>
     <l n="76" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">That Figg shou'd hit Sutton a stroke on the knee.</l>
     <l n="77" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Tho' Sutton disabled as soon as he hit him</l>
     <l n="78" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">Wou'd still have fought on, but Jove wou'd not permit him;</l>
     <l n="79" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">'Twas his fate, not his fault, that constrain'd him to yield,</l>
     <l n="80" met="--+|--+|--+|--+" line_length="12">And thus the great Figg became lord of the field.</l>
