     <l n="1">SAVE me! — What means you grisly shade,</l>
     <l n="2">Her stony eye-balls staring wide;</l>
     <l n="3">In soul, and tatter'd patches clad,</l>
     <l n="4">With dirt, and gore, and venom dy'd?</l>
     <l n="5">A burning brand she whirls around,</l>
     <l n="6">And stamps, and raves, and tears the ground,</l>
     <l n="7">And madly rends her clotted hair;</l>
     <l n="8">While thro' her canker'd breast are seen</l>
     <l n="9">Myriads of serpents bred within,</l>
     <l n="10">The cursed spawn of self consuming Care! —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="11">'Twas thus, O poor enamour'd maid,</l>
     <l n="12">The Stygian fiend approach'd the sea-girt tower,</l>
     <l n="13">What time, in sad misfortune's evil hour,</l>
     <l n="14">The faithless lamp Love's cynosure decay'd.</l>
     <l n="15">"And why," the ghastly phantom cries,</l>
     <l n="16">"Wilt thou, deluded Hero, wait</l>
     <l n="17">" Leander's wish'd return, forbid by Fate?</l>
     <l n="18">"See floating on his watery bier he lies;</l>
     <l n="19">" Pale are his cheeks, where Love was wont to play,</l>
     <l n="20">"And clos'd those radiant eyes, that late out-shone the day."</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="21">The woe-foreboding voice she heard,</l>
     <l n="22">And wishing, trembling pray'd for morn —</l>
     <l n="23">When lo! the bleeding corse appear'd,</l>
     <l n="24">By savage rocks all rudely torn!</l>
     <l n="25">Where were ye, Nymphs, O tell me where,</l>
     <l n="26">Daughters of Nereus, fresh and fair?</l>
     <l n="27">And why, sweet silver-footed Queen,</l>
     <l n="28">Would'st thou not leave thy coral cave,</l>
     <l n="29">And sooth the rough remorseless wave,</l>
     <l n="30">Ere Death had seiz'd thy best, thy boldest swain? —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="31">With haggard eyes, all-streaming blood,</l>
     <l n="32">Distracted Hero saw her lover slain,</l>
     <l n="33">And thrice indignant view'd the guilty main,</l>
     <l n="34">And thrice accus'd each merciless watry God.</l>
     <l n="35">Aye me in vain! — For "see, she cry'd,</l>
     <l n="36">" My dear Leander's beckoning shade!</l>
     <l n="37">"And canst thou live, O lost, O wretched maid?</l>
     <l n="38">" Shall envious Fate so fond a pair divide?</l>
     <l n="39">"Forbid it, Love!" — Then head-long from the tower</l>
     <l n="40">Deep in the ruthless flood she plung'd to rise no more!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="41">With scenes of woe, O cursed Power,</l>
     <l n="42">How are thy greedy eyes regal'd?</l>
     <l n="43">How did thy heart exult of yore,</l>
     <l n="44">When heaven's vindictive rod assail'd</l>
     <l n="45">The Queen of arts? — With giant-stride</l>
     <l n="46">Contagion stalks, and lo the bride,</l>
     <l n="47">The virgin-bride unpity'd dies!</l>
     <l n="48">Claspt to his daughter's throbbing breast,</l>
     <l n="49">The father breathes his soul to rest,</l>
     <l n="50">And sorrowing sons compose the widow'd mother's eyes?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="51">Scar'd by the Daemon's spotted hand,</l>
     <l n="52">The eagle scream'd, the famish'd vulture fled,</l>
     <l n="53">The hungry wolf forsook th' unburied dead,</l>
     <l n="54">And pale diseases shivering left the land!</l>
     <l n="55">What cries, and piercing shrieks resound</l>
     <l n="56">Thro' every street, at every fane?</l>
     <l n="57">Yet ah! they weep, they weary heaven in vain!</l>
     <l n="58">Death and Distraction stare on all around!</l>
     <l n="59">The wretched few, whom poisonous Pestilence spares,</l>
     <l n="60">Of moody madness die, and heart-distracting fears.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="61">These are thy deeds, O fell Despair,</l>
     <l n="62">Thou tyrant of the tortur'd soul,</l>
     <l n="63">Sister of pale-ey'd Grief, and Care,</l>
     <l n="64">At whose command impetuous roll</l>
     <l n="65">Passion's rough tides, and swelling high</l>
     <l n="66">Burst thro' each dear, and sacred tye,</l>
     <l n="67">And every pleasing thought o'erwhelm;</l>
     <l n="68">Anon the crazy bark is born,</l>
     <l n="69">Of winds, and waves, and rocks the scorn,</l>
     <l n="70">For Reason shrinks appall'd, and trembling quits the helm!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8">
     <l n="71">O fly, thou first born child of hell,</l>
     <l n="72">To some far distant, dreary, doleful plain,</l>
     <l n="73">Where starting Fear, and agonizing Pain,</l>
     <l n="74">And black Remorse, and sullen Sorrows dwell:</l>
     <l n="75">Where arm'd with poison, racks, and death,</l>
     <l n="76">Stern Horror rears his Gorgon head;</l>
     <l n="77">And writhing dreadful on the iron bed,</l>
     <l n="78">The purple Furies grind their canker'd teeth;</l>
     <l n="79">While percht on stubs of trees the shriek-owl sings,</l>
     <l n="80">And screaming deadly hoarse night-ravens flap their wings!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="81">Thither embost with varied woe,</l>
     <l n="82">Misfortune's pallid slave retires —</l>
     <l n="83">Hark, hark, he raves! — Thy tablet shew,</l>
     <l n="84">Charg'd with damn'd ghosts, and sulphurous fires.</l>
     <l n="85">Oh mercy, heaven! — Upstarting stands</l>
     <l n="86">His grisly hair; his nerveless hands</l>
     <l n="87">Shake; o'er his face the curdled blood,</l>
     <l n="88">From his swoln heart, with tidings flies:</l>
     <l n="89">"Give me another horse," he cries,</l>
     <l n="90">"Oh! bring the poison'd bowl, let loose Life's crimson flood!"</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10">
     <l n="91">Sad, sacred wretch! — Thou Power divine,</l>
     <l n="92">Whose god-like word from chaos dark and dread,</l>
     <l n="93">Bad Discord fly, and Light sweet-smiling spread</l>
     <l n="94">Her orient wing, controul this breast of mine!</l>
     <l n="95">And still when gloomy thoughts prevail,</l>
     <l n="96">Oh short, and partial be their sway!</l>
     <l n="97">And beam'd from thee, let Pleasure's gladsome ray</l>
     <l n="98">The mournful progeny of Grief dispel.</l>
     <l n="99">So shall the checquer'd scenes of Life delight,</l>
     <l n="100">As morning brighter peers preceded still by night.</l>
