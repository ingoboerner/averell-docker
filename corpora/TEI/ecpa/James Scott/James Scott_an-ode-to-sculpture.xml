    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">LED by the Muse, my step pervades</l>
     <l n="2">The sacred haunts, the peaceful shades,</l>
     <l n="3">Where  and  reign:</l>
     <l n="4">I see, I see, at their command,</l>
     <l n="5">The living stones in order stand,</l>
     <l n="6">And marble breathe through ev'ry vein!</l>
     <l n="7">breaks his hostile scythe; he sighs</l>
     <l n="8">To find his pow'r malignant fled;</l>
     <l n="9">"And what avails my dart, he cried,</l>
     <l n="10">"Since these can animate the dead?</l>
     <l n="11">"Since wak'd to mimic life, again in stone</l>
     <l n="12">"The patriot seems to speak, the heroe frown? "</l>
     <l n="13">There  silent train are seen,</l>
     <l n="14">Fast fix'd their looks, erect their mien.</l>
     <l n="15">Lo! while, with more than stoic soul,</l>
     <l n="16">The  exhausts the bowl,</l>
     <l n="17">A pale suffusion shades his eyes,</l>
     <l n="18">Till by degrees the marble dies!</l>
     <l n="19">See there the injur'd  bleed!</l>
     <l n="20">Ah! see he droops his languid head!</l>
     <l n="21">What starting nerves, what dying pain,</l>
     <l n="22">What horror freezes ev'ry vein!</l>
     <l n="23">These are thy works,  thine to shew</l>
     <l n="24">In rugged rock a feeling sense of woe.</l>
     <l n="25">Yet not alone such themes demand</l>
     <l n="26">The  stroke, the  hand;</l>
     <l n="27">I view with melting eyes</l>
     <l n="28">A softer scene of grief display'd,</l>
     <l n="29">While from her breast the duteous maid</l>
     <l n="30">Her  with food supplies.</l>
     <l n="31">In pitying stone she weeps, to see</l>
     <l n="32">His squalid hair, and galling chains:</l>
     <l n="33">And trembling, on her bended knee,</l>
     <l n="34">His hoary head her hand sustains;</l>
     <l n="35">While ev'ry look, and sorrowing feature prove,</l>
     <l n="36">How soft her breast, how great her filial love.</l>
     <l n="37">Lo! there the wild</l>
     <l n="38">With threat'ning brow, and frantic mien!</l>
     <l n="39">Revenge! revenge! the marble cries,</l>
     <l n="40">While fury sparkles in her eyes.</l>
     <l n="41">Thus was her aweful form beheld,</l>
     <l n="42">When  proud sons rebell'd;</l>
     <l n="43">She left the woman's vainer care,</l>
     <l n="44">And flew with loose dishevell'd hair;</l>
     <l n="45">She stretch'd her hand, imbru'd in blood,</l>
     <l n="46">While pale Sedition trembling stood;</l>
     <l n="47">In sudden silence, the mad crowd obey'd</l>
     <l n="48">Her aweful voice, and Stygian Discord fled!</l>
     <l n="49">With hope, or fear, or love, by turns,</l>
     <l n="50">The marble leaps, or shrinks, or burns,</l>
     <l n="51">As  waves her hand;</l>
     <l n="52">The varying passions of the mind</l>
     <l n="53">Her faithful handmaids are assign'd,</l>
     <l n="54">And rise and fall by her command.</l>
     <l n="55">When now life's wasted lamps expire,</l>
     <l n="56">When sinks to dust this mortal frame,</l>
     <l n="57">She, like Prometheus, grasps the fire;</l>
     <l n="58">Her touch revives the lambent flame;</l>
     <l n="59">While phoenix-like, the statesman, bard, or sage,</l>
     <l n="60">Spring fresh to life, and breathe through every age.</l>
     <l n="61">Hence, where the organ full and clear,</l>
     <l n="62">With loud hosannas charms the ear,</l>
     <l n="63">Behold (a prism within his hands)</l>
     <l n="64">Absorb'd in thought, great  stands;</l>
     <l n="65">Such was his solemn wonted state,</l>
     <l n="66">His serious brow, and musing gait,</l>
     <l n="67">When, taught on eagles-wings to fly,</l>
     <l n="68">He trac'd the wonders of the sky;</l>
     <l n="69">The chambers of the sun explor'd,</l>
     <l n="70">Where tints of thousand hues are stor'd;</l>
     <l n="71">Whence every flower in painted robes is drest,</l>
     <l n="72">And varying  steals her gaudy vest.</l>
     <l n="73">Here, as  heavenly queen,</l>
     <l n="74">Conducts her best, her fav'rite train,</l>
     <l n="75">At  shrine they bow!</l>
     <l n="76">And while with raptur'd eyes they gaze,</l>
     <l n="77">With  purest vestal rays,</l>
     <l n="78">Behold their ardent bosoms glow!</l>
     <l n="79">Hail, mighty mind! hail, aweful name!</l>
     <l n="80">I feel inspir'd my lab'ring breast;</l>
     <l n="81">And lo! I pant, I burn for fame!</l>
     <l n="82">Come, Science, bright etherial guest,</l>
     <l n="83">Oh come, and lead thy meanest, humblest son,</l>
     <l n="84">Through  arduous paths to fair renown.</l>
     <l n="85">Could I to one faint ray aspire,</l>
     <l n="86">One spark of that celestial fire,</l>
     <l n="87">The leading cynosure, that glow'd</l>
     <l n="88">While  explor'd the dark abode,</l>
     <l n="89">Where  sate on  shrine,</l>
     <l n="90">How great my boast! what praise were mine!</l>
     <l n="91">Illustrious sage! who first could'st tell</l>
     <l n="92">Wherein the power of  dwell;</l>
     <l n="93">And ev'ry magic chain untie,</l>
     <l n="94">That binds the soul of</l>
     <l n="95">To  when mould'ring in the dust,</l>
     <l n="96">To  shall swell the breathing bust:</l>
     <l n="97">Shall here (for this reward thy merits claim)</l>
     <l n="98">"Stand next in place to  as in fame."</l>
