    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">WILD midst the teeming buds of opening May,</l>
     <l n="2">Breaking large branches from the flow'ry thorn,</l>
     <l n="3">O'er the fern'd hills see ROSAMONDA stray,</l>
     <l n="4">Scattering the pearls which the gay leaves adorn!</l>
     <l n="5">Her ringlets o'er her temples play,</l>
     <l n="6">Flush'd with the orient splendour of the morn.</l>
     <l n="7">The sun broke forth-and wide its glories threw,</l>
     <l n="8">Blushing along the sky, and sparkling in the dew.</l>
     <l n="9">The plains gay-glitter'd with ethereal light;</l>
     <l n="10">And the field-melody,</l>
     <l n="11">Nature's wild harmony,</l>
     <l n="12">Breath'd love, and sang delight!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2">
     <l n="13">Fresh ROSAMONDE the glowing scene surveys,</l>
     <l n="14">Her youthful bosom inly stung with pain;</l>
     <l n="15">Early amid the shadowy trees she strays,</l>
     <l n="16">Her shining ears the starting tears restrain;</l>
     <l n="17">While tyrant Love within her pulses plays,</l>
     <l n="18">O'er the wet grass she flew with wild disdain.</l>
     <l n="19">She flew from thought, and far</l>
     <l n="20">She sang, and hail'd the morning star.</l>
     <l n="21">Her voice was pinion'd on the wind,</l>
     <l n="22">Which wafts her notes around;</l>
     <l n="23">Encircling zephyrs caught each sound,</l>
     <l n="24">And bore them echoing through the wood,</l>
     <l n="25">Where pleas'd offended URBAN stood,</l>
     <l n="26">With archest smile, yet musical and kind:</l>
     <l n="27">Conquering the sigh, she gayly sung,</l>
     <l n="28">And scorn loud-trembled on her wiery tongue.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="29">While URBAN stood, and held her in his eyes,</l>
     <l n="30">He to his lips applies</l>
     <l n="31">The soft-breath'd flute;</l>
     <l n="32">Whose notes, when touch'd with art,</l>
     <l n="33">Steal to the inmost heart,</l>
     <l n="34">And throw the tyrannizing spirit down -</l>
     <l n="35">While vanity and pride are charm'd and mute.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="36">Those lays reach'd ROSAMONDA'S ear,</l>
     <l n="37">She fluttering, like a bird whom fear</l>
     <l n="38">Has drawn within the fascinating serpent's fangs,</l>
     <l n="39">Unable to conceal the pangs</l>
     <l n="40">Of pride, conflicting with returning love,</l>
     <l n="41">To hide her blushes, darts amid the grove:</l>
     <l n="42">Sweet showers fast sprinkle from her lovely eyes,</l>
     <l n="43">Which drown her short-liv'd scorn;</l>
     <l n="44">But as she moves the young musician flies,</l>
     <l n="45">Leaves her all wild, sad, weeping, and forlorn!</l>
