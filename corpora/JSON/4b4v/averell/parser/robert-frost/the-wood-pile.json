The view was all in lines\nStraight up and down of tall slim trees\nToo much alike to mark or name a place by\nSo as to say for certain I was here\nOr somewhere else: I was just far from home.\nA small bird flew before me. He was careful\nTo put a tree between us when he lighted,\nAnd say no word to tell me who he was\nWho was so foolish as to think what he thought.\nHe thought that I was after him for a feather--\nThe white one in his tail; like one who takes\nEverything said as personal to himself.\nOne flight out sideways would have undeceived him.\nAnd then there was a pile of wood for which\nI forgot him and let his little fear\nCarry him off the way I might have gone,\nWithout so much as wishing him good-night.\nHe went behind it to make his last stand.\nIt was a cord of maple, cut and split\nAnd piled--and measured, four by four by eight.\nAnd not another like it could I see.\nNo runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.\nAnd it was older sure than this year's cutting,\nOr even last year's or the year's before.\nThe wood was gray and the bark warping off it\nAnd the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis\nHad wound strings round and round it like a bundle.\nWhat held it though on one side was a tree\nStill growing, and on one a stake and prop,\nThese latter about to fall. I thought that only\nSomeone who lived in turning to fresh tasks\nCould so forget his handiwork on which\nHe spent himself, the labor of his ax,\nAnd leave it there far from a useful fireplace\nTo warm the frozen swamp as best it could\nWith the slow smokeless burning of decay."
